Surah 24:1 ,        A sura which We have sent down and which We have ordained in it have We sent down Clear Signs in order that ye may receive admonition.,(Nana) Sura uyio na Yi cin be na Yi ma'a hukunci nazhi fibo na la'azhe wajibi Yima cin ayazhi be fi bo nazhi bayani'azhi yi gangba na ebo be wuncin'y ye lae san'etu.
Surah 24:2 ,                        The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case in a matter prescribed by Allah if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.,Yancin daci yinzagi to yancin daci bagi edin zaeni ndondo miniabo bulala shitsun ye mae ga lugwa yegun ndoci lo-ye beayin dan mini alamari adini Soko nanao ma ye ga'afe gan yea imani jin be Sokoe to be Efo zobae na. Amaade jamaa mini muminizhio nazhia jin ri yan haddi bulala nana na.
Surah 24:4    ,              And those who launch a charge against chaste women and produce not four witnesses (to support their allegations)- flog them with eighty stripes; and reject their evidence ever after: for such men are wicked transgressors;-,To zanazhi ma'ajin afe ce egan yan yancinda ta yinzagi nazhi yibe yawoe na gancin ama be be eri gunni yin'ana to edin'a bulala shini ye mae ga -- eri egwa'abo be ma har abada za wuncin zhima agayi fasikizhio.
Surah 24:3    ,             Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry and but a woman similarly guilty or an Unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an Unbeliever marry such a woman: to the Believers such a thing is forbidden.,Yancin daci bagi wyun'a jin yawoa sai be yancin daci yinzagi na yi yancin dacina zan dondoa jin'u yawoa sai yancindaci bagi ko mushriki ama wuncin laajin haramu ya muminizhi.
Surah 24:5     ,     Unless they repent thereafter and mend (their conduct); for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Sai de zanazhi ga tuba jin zunma wuncin'ona acia bolobolo ladan etun'azhio na to hakika Soko Etsu gaafara uyio Etsu yegun Uyio.
Surah 24:6 ,               And for those who launch a charge against their spouses and have (in support) no evidence but their own- their solitary evidence (can be received) if they bear witness four times (with an oath) by Allah that they are solemnly telling the truth;,To zanazhi ma'ajin afe ce egan yacin-da da ba yinmiazhina amade eri ndondoa sai eti tacin'a na to eri na zandondoa ya na (uga yi) ula eri'u ya be sunna Sokoe zun gunni kede; hakika gaskiya wyun'e tao na.
Surah 24:7 ,       And the fifth (oath) (should be) that they solemnly invoke the curse of Allah on themselves if they tell a lie.,Yan tsunci gancin uciu gangan: Emibo yan Soko ulaujin tabbata'uta eti wyun bo wyun ga'afe dan mini ganmana zunci zhio na.S
urah 24:8   ,       But it would avert the punishment from the wife if she bears witness four times (with an oath) By Allah that (her husband) is telling a lie;,Yanna ma'ada azaba haddi gwa ya eti yin mio na ugayi; wyuntso'ula eriu ya be sunna Sokoe zu-gunni kede hakika eba wyun'afe dan mini ganmana zunci zhio no (wato ganmana eba zun'o).
Surah 24:9  ,      And the fifth (oath) should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of Allah on herself if (her accuser) is telling the truth.,Yan tsunci gancin kede; hakika ewunzhe yan Soko'ula'ujin tabbata'uta eti wyun bo wun'ayi gaskiya eba wyun tao na.
Surah 24:10 ,       If it were not for Allah´s grace and mercy on you and that Allah is Oft-Returning full of Wisdom- (Ye would be ruined indeed).,Kagan ujin ebo falala yan Soko be yegun'uyin ta eti yebo na'a Soko ma kezhe aafe Etsu nae -- tuba na Etsu na yi Egba na.
Surah 24:11    ,                       Those who brought forward the lie are a body among yourselves: think it not to be an evil to you; On the contrary it is good for you: to every man among them (will come the punishment) of the sin that he earned and to him who took on himself the lead among them will be a penalty grievous.,Hakika zanazhi be be egan ganmana gbonta wuncin'ina jama'a ndoci ayio dagan miniyebo to ega leuye ke eyan dede wun'ayi yayeo ma a'a alheri wun'ay ya yeyeo. Zaeni ndondo miniabo yibe zunubi yanna ujin yan lefi nazana ma shiti yan etun dede wuncin na azaba na gbota na ga'ajin tabbata yau.
Surah 24:12 ,          Why did not the believers - men and women - when ye heard of the affair- put the best construction on it in their own minds and say "This (charge) is an obvious lie",Ki'ila kamina ye wo egan nana-na muminizhi to bagi to yinzagi aci jin zato wangi lo'ba dozhia yin'o Acia gangan; nana de ganmana tswitswaci uyio nayi gbangba na.
Surah 24:13  ,           Why did they not bring four witnesses to prove it When they have not brought the witnesses such men in the sight of Allah (stand forth) themselves as liars!,Ki'ila aci be be eri gun'ni yin'a yin'o To dagan na abe be erizhi yin'a na to zawuncinzhi eba Soko agayi ganmana-zunci zhio.
Surah 24:14   ,           Were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you in this world and the Hereafter a grievous penalty would have seized you in that ye rushed glibly into this affair.,Kagan umajin ebo falala Soko be yegun'U yin na tati yebo izheo to ekuo na'a daa azaba na gbota na ga'ade ye dan mini etun nazhi yelo nao.
Surah 24:15  ,             Behold ye received it on your tongues and said out of your mouths things of which ye had no knowledge; and ye thought it to be a light matter while it was most serious in the sight of Allah.,Kamina ye fe tswa eganzhi gan begintra ye yin na yeci fe da gan gan be misun yezhi yan yannazhi yede kpikpeaa na ye cie le ye gan yanna de sauki na uyio alaalima yanna gbota na uyi eba Soko bo.
Surah 24:16 ,            And why did ye not when ye heard it say - "It is not right of us to speak of this: Glory to Allah! this is a most serious slander!",E gangan kamina ye wo egan wuncin na ye gan gan: "U-- yin na yia gangan iri nana naa lili kpaata ma'ajin tabbata ya Soko nana de ganmana tswitswaci uyio na yi gbonta na.
Surah 24:17 ,       Allah doth admonish you that ye may never repeat such (conduct) if ye are (true) Believers.,Sokoe na'e wun yega kaara jin iri wuncin be ma har abada wun'ayi muminizhi ye yio na.
Surah 24:18 ,     And Allah makes the Signs plain to you: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.,Soko mae jin bayani ayazhi yaye Soko ma Etsu kpikpe Uyio Etsu hikima.
Surah 24:19  ,                 Those who love (to see) scandal published broadcast among the Believers will have a grievous Penalty in this life and in the Hereafter: Allah knows and ye know not.Hakika zanazhie wagan etun alfahsha ula'u gau mi ba dan taacin muminizhio na azaba na tan na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a dan izheo to Alkiyamio Soko gama de kpikpeo ye (zawangi zhi) ye de kpikpea.
Surah 24:20  ,      Were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you and that Allah is full of kindness and mercy (ye would be ruined indeed).,Kagan ujin ebo falala yan Soko be yegun'Uyin na ta eti yebo naa be hakika yan Etsu tosayi be Etsu yegun'y na Soko yi naa (da ye gaaya gun gushe hallakao).
Surah 24:21 ,                                O ye who believe! follow not Satan´s footsteps: if any will follow the footsteps of Satan he will (but) command what is shameful and wrong: and were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you not one of you would ever have been pure: but Allah doth purify whom He pleases: and Allah is One Who hears and knows (all things).,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la mitu eta yan shetan zhi ma ebo na zandondo nagae la mitu eta yan shetanzhi nahakika wyun'ejin za foro jin be etun alfahshae be etun na Sokoe wa'a nae kagan umajin ebo falala Soko be yegun'Uyin na ta eti ye bo naa ade zaeni ndondo miniebo na'a li naa har abada amaade Soko'ajin u li zana gabaUna. Soko ma Etsu nae wo na Uyio Etsu kpikpe Uyio.
Surah 24:22 ,                        Let not those among you who are endued with grace and amplitude of means resolve by oath against helping their kinsmen those in want and those who have left their homes in Allah´s cause: let them forgive and overlook do you not wish that Allah should forgive you For Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Zanazhi mayi eza falalazhi mini yebo amayi eza bagwo na aga zhi kuti gan aajin alheri ya dangi yan tsonba zhia mato eza gwagbagizhi to zanazhi kpela dagan ezhiazhio bo Soko'na.

Surah 24:23 ,           Those who slander chaste women indiscreet but believing are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter: for them is a grievous Penalty-,Hakika zanazhie ce egan dede (yan yancinda) da ba yinzagi nazhie wan minia dan egwa'a madan be etun banza yin'ana amayi muminazhi na to Sokoa bo mi izheo to ekuo azaba na gbota na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 24:23  ,          Those who slander chaste women indiscreet but believing are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter: for them is a grievous Penalty-,Hakika zanazhie ce egan dede (yan yancinda) da ba yinzagi nazhie wan minia dan egwa'a madan be etun banza yin'ana amayi muminazhi na to Sokoa bo mi izheo to ekuo azaba na gbota na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 24:24,        On the Day when their tongues their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to their actions.,Efo'e be dan'ona na gintara'azhi to egwa'azhi to biciazhi aafe ya eri etiabo na be iri etu nazhi afe lo na.
Surah 24:25,          On that Day Allah will pay them back (all) their just dues and they will realise that Allah is the (very) Truth that makes all things manifest.,Efo wuncin Soko ga egagba etun'azhi laya'a gun gunci amaakpe foga kede Soko gayi Etsu gaskiya natso yi gbangba nao.
Surah 24:26   ,            Women impure are for men impure and men impure for women impure and women of purity are for men of purity and men of purity are for women of purity: these are not affected by what people say: for them there is forgiveness and a provision honourable.,Yinzagi dedezhi yan baagi dedezhi ayio baagi dedezhio tsoma yan yinzagi dedezhi ayio yinzagi lilicizhi ma yan baagi lilicizhi ayio baagi lilicizhi ma yan yinzagi lilicizhi ayio.

Surah 24:27  ,               O ye who believe! enter not houses other than your own until ye have asked permission and saluted those in them: that is best for you in order that ye may heed (what is seemly).,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega fe da gandan'a emi nazhi jin yan ye yea nama har sai yega wa izini ye cia sallama jin be dzo ya za'n'bagazhi. Wuncin ga de alheri gan ya ye yeo ujin wo be wuncin'y ye ga'ade sin-santu.
Surah 24:28,                     If ye find no one in the house enter not until permission is given to you: if ye are asked to go back go back: that makes for greater purity for yourselves: and Allah knows well all that ye do.,Kagan ma ye tsun zando danboa to ega gandan boma har sai aga yaye izini be dzo ama ga be gan ye gan kezhe to e kezhe wuncin gayi lili ya ye yeo Soko ma yibe kpikpe yannazhi ye jin nae.
Surah 24:29,                It is no fault on your part to enter houses not used for living in which serve some (other) use for you: And Allah has knowledge of what ye reveal and what ye conceal.,Lefi ma danbo na ye'a gandan emi nazhi zando dan'a naa yin'a to to kaaya ye ga fibo na. Soko ma yibe kpikpe yannazhi ye gae la wu na to nazhi yegae swo nae.
Surah 24:30  ,            Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty: that will make for greater purity for them: And Allah is well acquainted with all that they do.,Gan ya muminizhi gan ala bacin leazhi'apan'ake cin cin le (yinzagi zazhia) lugwa amaa tswa kafa'azhi wuncin gala lili yaa gan'o. Soko ma yi be kpikpe yannazhie jin nae.

Surah 24:32  ,              Marry those among you who are single or the virtuous ones among yourselves male or female: if they are in poverty Allah will give them means out of His grace: for Allah encompasseth all and he knoweth all things.,Ye mae jin yawoe ya ekpanzhi mini yebo to nazhi yi zaguruzhi mini wuzhi bagizhio to wuzhi yinzagizhio na. aga'afe talakazhi to (bele yin ) Sokoajin bagwo ya'a dagan edzunba arzikiUbo Soko ma Etsu bagwo Uyio Etsu kpikpe.
Surah 24:33     ,                                          Let those who find not the wherewithal for marriage keep themselves chaste until Allah gives them means out of His grace. And if any of your slaves ask for a deed in writing (to enable them to earn their freedom for a certain sum) give them such a deed if ye know any good in them: yea give them something yourselves out of the means which Allah has given to you. But force not your maids to prostitution when they desire chastity in order that ye may make a gain in the goods of this life. But if anyone compels them yet after such compulsion is Allah Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful (to them),Zanazhi ma la'ade yanna aga'ajin yawo na'a na ala minia'awan har da kamina Soko ga'ajin bagwo ya'a dagan arzikiUbo na.

Surah 24:34       ,     We have already sent down to you verses making things clear an illustration from (the story of) people who passed away before you and an admonition for those who fear (Allah).,Hakika Yima cin ayazhi be yaye nazhi yi gbangba na amayi kotonci dagan (etan) zanazhi le izhe nana shidzo batsozhio na amayi ewun na ya zanazhi gae sundan Soko na.
Surah 24:35         ,                                      Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The Parable of His Light is as if there were a Niche and within it a Lamp: the Lamp enclosed in Glass: the glass as it were a brilliant star: Lit from a blessed Tree an Olive neither of the east nor of the west whose oil is well-nigh luminous though fire scarce touched it: Light upon Light! Allah doth guide whom He will to His Light: Allah doth set forth Parables for men: and Allah doth know all things.,Soko gayi Hiske-ko yan sanmazhi to kin yin'o kotonci yan HaskeU ke (mishkat)na fitila gun miniu bona;fitila wuncin ma ugun mini kpalabao kpalaba wuncin ma ke wyoa ye gan ko tswangi alu'ului na uyio e dan'udan be emi cigban ndoci na yi yan albarka na na yi yan zaituni na.

Surah 24:36  ,           (Lit is such a Light) in houses which Allah hath permitted to be raised to honour; for the celebration in them of His name: In them is He glorified in the mornings and in the evenings (again and again)-,Dan mini kata nazhi Soko jin foro gan ala'atu na ama'afea tun sunna Soko'a yea fibo amaafe ajin tasbiinu'afibo to laazhin to lozun-na.
Surah 24:37  ,                By men whom neither traffic nor merchandise can divert from the Remembrance of Allah nor from regular Prayer nor from the practice of regular Charity: Their (only) fear is for the Day when hearts and eyes will be transformed (in a world wholly new)-,Eza bagizhi ayio na woce to shishi be kun-kun'y wun'ejin'a shegala ke pipa Soko lugwa'a na. Amae la salla ku gikini amae la zakka wa e sundan efo na yangban'azhi to eyeazhia fe nyan-nyan na.
Surah 24:38     ,        That Allah may reward them according to the best of their deeds and add even more for them out of His Grace: for Allah doth provide for those whom He will without measure.,Ebo ma Soko'U ga'agba be bolo-bolo etun nazhi alona Uma'u nea-bibe dagan mini falalaUbo. Soko mae la arzikiazhi ya zana ga baUna umayi be lisafi yin'a na.
Surah 24:39    ,                 But the Unbelievers- their deeds are like a mirage in sandy deserts which the man parched with thirst mistakes for water; until when he comes up to it he finds it to be nothing: But he finds Allah (ever) with him and Allah will pay him his account: and Allah is swift in taking account.,Zanazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na etun'azhi uyi ke kotonkoci kin na igidi sankpe na dagan ba kpaako zana nuwan'e wo na ga le'uye wyun'a ye gan ko nuwan (yan gaskiyao) har sai kamina ugabe tun baga na wyun'atsun yando ciboa.

Surah 24:40      ,                          Or (the Unbelievers´ state) is like the depths of darkness in a vast deep ocean overwhelmed with billow topped by billow topped by (dark) clouds: depths of darkness one above another: if a man stretches out his hands he can hardly see it! for any to whom Allah giveth not light there is no light!,Koma ke kotonci bazhikozhi dan mini edu na shiko sarauyin na na kunfa yan nuwan'a lakpeu na titaubo be kunfa ndoci ke kpetiubo gancin girgiji ci ta titaubo be.

Surah 24:41 ,                   Seest thou not that it is Allah Whose praises all beings in the heavens and on earth do celebrate and the birds (of the air) with wings outspread Each one knows its own (mode of) prayer and praise. And Allah knows well all that they do.,Wyole ye gan hakika yannazhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo na kpaata'a e li Soko tsatsayin'a acinga to eleugi nazhie ga gwapa'azhi naa Alita ndondo yi be kpikpe ibada na wyun'ajin to lili na wyun'afe li Soko na.

Surah 24:42   ,   Yea to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and to Allah is the final goal (of all).,Soko gama wyun mulki sanmazhi to kin yin'o. Eba'U gabo ma ezhekeba kpaata dan'o.
Surah 24:43  ,                                   Seest thou not that Allah makes the clouds move gently then joins them together then makes them into a heap - then wilt thou see rain issue forth from their midst. And He sends down from the sky mountain masses (of clouds) wherein is hail: He strikes therewith whom He pleases and He turns it away from whom He pleases the vivid flash of His lightning well-nigh blinds the sight.,Wyo le kendoe Sokoajin Ufe da girgijezhi gwa na yea gancin Ucia jin Wyun'a kukeba be dozhi gabcin Uci ga'a latu ta etidozhio wyocia le nuwan ye wun'ajin ufe tinya tsakaniabo Uma'ajin U duzhin dagan sanmao nuwan yan kankarazhi Uciajin udule wuncin fi za na gabaUna Umae lau kan zana ga baUna haske yan sanma dzwan'uzhi e jinke aga eye zawangizhi na-na.

Surah 24:45      ,                        And Allah has created every animal from water: of them there are some that creep on their bellies; some that walk on two legs; and some that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills for verily Allah has power over all things.,Soko ga jin alitta dabba ndondo dagan nuwan bo ade nazhie gba-gba kpe gbako'abo na ade nazhie dazan ta eti bici gubao na amade nazhie dazan ta eti bici gunnio na.

Surah 24:45       ,                       And Allah has created every animal from water: of them there are some that creep on their bellies; some that walk on two legs; and some that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills for verily Allah has power over all things.,Soko ga jin alitta dabba ndondo dagan nuwan bo ade nazhie gba-gba kpe gbako'abo na ade nazhie dazan ta eti bici gubao na amade nazhie dazan ta eti bici gunnio na.

Surah 24:46      ,    We have indeed sent down signs that make things manifest: and Allah guides whom He wills to a way that is straight.,Hakika Yicin ayazhi be nazhi jin bayani yandondo na. Soko ma'ajin U wu zana gabaUna ba lo eko natso yi gboro na.
Surah 24:47     ,         They say "We believe in Allah and in the messenger and we obey": but even after that some of them turn away: they are not (really) Believers.,Aciajin afe gan gan: Yia imani jin be Sokoe to be Tuci'y yima'emi tua. Gancin baci wuncin'o sashi miniabo ci ga zunma zheta zawuncinzhia.
