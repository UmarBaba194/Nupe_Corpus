Surah 9:1,        A (declaration) of immunity from Allah and His Messenger to those of the Pagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances:-,Egwa-wa danna dagan eba Soko to Tuciu lo eba zanazhi ye jin alkawali beyin mini zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci nao.
Surah 9:2 ,            Go ye then for four months backwards and forwards (as ye will) throughout the land but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah (by your falsehood) but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him.,Ebo acin'o efe dazan kpe eti kinbo har etswa gunni (kafa uyio na Soko ya kafirizhi na) ye mae kpe-ewo kede ye yegan Soko gwa woa na hakika ma Soko ga kafirizhi sunzunye.
Surah 9:3                               And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger to the people (assembled) on the day o,f the Great Pilgrimage- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then ye repent it were best for you; but if ye turn away know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith.,Emi-ya ma danna dagan eba Soko to Tuciuyin lo eba zawangizhi efo haji wanciko kede hakika Soko to Tuciu agwa'a wa be zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci nae. Ebo acin'o ye ga tuba jin to wuncin'afe alheri yae gan ye ma ga zunma zheta to yekpe-ewo kede hakika ye gan Soko gwa'a na wyo mao ya zanazhia jin kafirinci na labari yan azaba na yi tintanci na.
Surah 9:4        ,             (But the treaties are) not dissolved with those Pagans with whom ye have entered into alliance and who have not subsequently failed you in aught nor aided any one against you. So fulfil your engagements with them to the end of their term: for Allah loveth the righteous.,Sai de zanazhi ye ga jin alkawali be yin mini zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci gancin ma ake ye yandondoa na amajin zandondo taimako be gunye kun'ana to yea alkawaliazhi she ya'har da lokaci na yega jin yeda bedozhina. Hakika Soko wyun'e wa zanazhi gaetswa Soko cie sundan'una.
Surah 9:5   ,                      But when the forbidden months are past then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them an seize them beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Gancin-ma etswa yan alfurma zhi ga'a gwo gan to egun mushirikizhi kun bandondo na ye ga tswo'a gwa-na ye mae la'ae wan ye mae la'ae kan'edan ye mae tsoe ka'a ecinba ndondo. Gancin aga bea tuba jin acia sallah ku gikini acia zakka dukiya'azhi wa to yea ekoa ya ya'a. Hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun ma uyio
Surah 9:6          ,       If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum grant it to him so that he may hear the word of Allah; and then escort him to where he can be secure. That is because they are men without knowledge.,Za eni ndondo mini mushirikizhio na ga wa tsonba wyoe ebo tswitswa'ona egwo'u tswa har u-wo egan Soko gancin ye cie la wyun'elobana uga'de aminci na wuncin mayi ebo na a'fe jama'a nazhi de kpikpea na.
Surah 9:7      ,                How can there be a league before Allah and His Messenger with the Pagans except those with whom ye made a treaty near the sacred Mosque As long as these stand true to you stand ye true to them: for Allah doth love the righteous.,Ke wun'a yi yi mushirikizhi cia de alkawali ndoci dan be Sokoe to be Tuci'u yin nao Sai de nazhi ye ga jin alkawali be yin eba massalaci haramio na. To atso gaa da gboro be ye yin to yetso a da b-- ro bea yin. Hakika Sokoe wa zanazhi gae tswau acie sundan'u na.
Surah 9:8     ,          How (can there be such a league) seeing that if they get an advantage over you they respect not in you the ties either of kinship or of covenant With (fair words from) their mouths they entice you but their hearts are averse from you; and most of them are rebellious and wicked.,Ke'u yi yi nao ala'lima aga'ade zankpe ta eti yebo a'atswa zumunci ndondo ko amana be yin'a yin'o Ade'ajin afe jin yeda be ye yin yan misun'azhi yangban'azhi mae navo. Ekun-dondo ma fasikizhi ayio.
Surah 9:9  ,          The Signs of Allah have they sold for a miserable price and (many) have they hindered from His way: evil indeed are the deeds they have done,.A aya Soko zhi la'ashi ewo-izhe na yi te ten gi na gancin acie kan zawangi zhi ezan ta eti ekpa Soko. Hakika zawuncin zhi etun nae lo na a biye.
Surah 9:10     ,    In a Believer they respect not the ties either of kinship or of covenant! It is they who have transgressed all bounds.E tswa zumun ci ndondo ya muminia baleotso acia gangan alkawalia zawuncin zhi ma aga yi zanazhie gbin iya ka tu nao.
Surah 9:11    ,        But (even so) if they repent establish regular prayers and practise regular charity- they are your brethren in Faith: (thus) do We explain the Signs in detail for those who understand.,To aga bea tuba jin acia sallah ku gikini acia zakka dukiya'azhi wa to a'zhe yegi yezhi'ani dan'ona mini adinio. Yi mae kpe ayazhi ye ka ka yin ya zanazhi ga de kpikpe na.
Surah 9:11  ,          But (even so) if they repent establish regular prayers and practise regular charity- they are your brethren in Faith: (thus) do We explain the Signs in detail for those who understand.,To aga bea tuba jin acia sallah ku gikini acia zakka dukiya'azhi wa to a'zhe yegi yezhi'ani dan'ona mini adinio. Yi mae kpe ayazhi ye ka ka yin ya zanazhi ga de kpikpe na.
Surah 9:12        ,         But if they violate their oaths after their covenant and taunt you for your Faith- fight ye the chiefs of Unfaith: for their oaths are nothing to them: that thus they may be restrained.,Ama ga kuti nazhia zhi na lo ya baci na a alkawali jin na acie ke zhe tun adini ye zhi yan (be egan de de zhi) to egun dzoshicin yan kafirin ci zhi kun. Hakika a ade kuti zhi yan gaskiya dan bea yin'a: ujin wo be wunci'y aga egwa kpe yan na akan-nao.
Surah 9:13   ,                Will ye not fight people who violated their oaths plotted to expel the Messenger and took the aggressive by being the first (to assault) you Do ye fear them Nay it is Allah Whom ye should more justly fear if ye believe!,Kashi ye'a gun zana zhia kutizhiazhi leba na kun'a ama kezhea kpa gan aga tuci nyan-dzun na'a agama ka'yn dzun fi ye eti wun bo Soko tsa gwoyin na yea sundan'u nao wun'a yi mumini zhi ye yio na.
Surah 9:13 ,                  Will ye not fight people who violated their oaths plotted to expel the Messenger and took the aggressive by being the first (to assault) you Do ye fear them Nay it is Allah Whom ye should more justly fear if ye believe!,Kashi ye'a gun zana zhia kutizhiazhi leba na kun'a ama kezhea kpa gan aga tuci nyan-dzun na'a agama ka'yn dzun fi ye eti wun bo Soko tsa gwoyin na yea sundan'u nao wun'a yi mumini zhi ye yio na.
Surah 9:14      ,    Fight them and Allah will punish them by your hands cover them with shame help you (to victory) over them heal the breasts of Believers,E gun'a kun Soko'ajin'a azaba be egwa ye zhi uma ga'a sun zun ye uma'a jin'e taimako ta etiabo uma ga fifo la'adan yangban mumini zhio.
Surah 9:15      ,    And still the indignation of their hearts. For Allah will turn (in mercy) to whom He will; and Allah is All-Knowing All-Wise.,U m a ga ewunzhe na fi yangba'azhio na la keyabo Soko ma'agwo tuba yan za na ga ba una. Soko ma Etsu hikima Uyio.
Surah 9:16           ,            Or think ye that ye shall be abandoned as though Allah did not know those among you who strive with might and main and take none for friends and protectors except Allah His Messenger and the (community of) Believers But Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.,Kashi ye kpa ye kpa gan ala ye yea lugwa tun Soko la'ala elatu dan zanazhie jin jihidi mini yebo ama la zandondo zunma Soko be tuciu yin be mumini zhi eya man cia na Sokoma yi be kpikpe yan etun nazhi ye lo na.
Surah 9:17         ,        It is not for such as join gods with Allah to visit or maintain the mosques of Allah while they witness against their own souls to infidelity. The works of such bear no fruit: In Fire shall they dwell.,Ugwoyin ya mushiriki zhi na'afe layedan masallaci Soko na'a ala'ali ma atso jin ri ya titaacin'a be etun kafirinci nae lo na. Zawuncinzhi etun'azhi kpata-agbin ya ena bo amaa'afi tu tun yin'o.
Surah 9:18       ,               The mosques of Allah shall be visited and maintained by such as believe in Allah and the Last Day establish regular prayers and practise regular charity and fear none (at all) except Allah. It is they who are expected to be on true guidance.,Hakika de zanazhia la yedan masallaci Soko na aga yi zana zhi ga imani jin be Sokoe nao to be efo zobae ucia sallah kugikini na ucia zakka dukiya'u wa nao gancin umae sundan zandoa sai de Soko. To kengi uyio zawuncin zhia la'afe dan mini eza bawuzhio.
Surah 9:19                ,       Do ye make the giving of drink to pilgrims or the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque equal to (the pious service of) those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and strive with might and main in the cause of Allah They are not comparable in the sight of Allah: and Allah guides not those who do wrong.,Kashi ye ga eyanfinci na ye la ya alhaji zhi na to eye na ye ladan masallaci harami na lasan tatu be zana'a imani jin be Sokoe to be efo-zobae uci kezhe jin kokari ta ekpa Soko ebo elatu musulun ciona A'fe ye'ni eba Soko boa. Soko mae la jama'a yan azwalumi zhi ke eko gurua.
Surah 9:20       ,        Those who believe and suffer exile and strive with might and main in Allah´s cause with their goods and their persons have the highest rank in the sight of Allah: they are the people who will achieve (salvation).,Zana zhia imani jin na acia kpe la ke eyan de de lugwa na acie jin kokari ta eti ekpa Soko be dukiya'a zhi to rayia zhi na ayibe daraja na wancin gan na eba Soko zawunci zhi maaga yi eza rabo zhio.
Surah 9:21   ,      Their Lord doth give them glad tidings of a Mercy from Himself of His good pleasure and of gardens for them wherein are delights that endure:,Tsocia mae ya'a labari yangbanfa be yegun ndoci dagan eba ubo ganna be yeda jin-y be emi aljanna zhi miniabo eman zhi danbo na'azoa na.
Surah 9:22 ,      They will dwell therein for ever. Verily in Allah´s presence is a reward the greatest (of all).,Ba'gabo ma afi tutun yin-o.Hakika egagba na wancin na udan be sokoe.
Surah 9:23    ,              O ye who believe! take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers if they love infidelity above Faith: if any of you do so they do wrong.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la mima'ezhi to ye gi ezhi masoyi zhi ma a beke aga cin cin la'aya kafirinci ta eti imanio na. Za eni ndondo miniebo na ga la'a masoyi na to zawunci zhi aga yi azwalumi zhio.
Surah 9:24    ,                            Say: If it be that your fathers your sons your brothers your mates or your kindred; the wealth that ye have gained; the commerce in which ye fear a decline: or the dwellings in which ye delight - are dearer to you than Allah or His Messenger or the striving in His cause;- then wait until Allah brings about His decision: and Allah guides not the rebellious.,Gan cin : wun'a yi gan ba ba ye zhi to egi ye zhi to yegi ye zhi to nyimi ye zhi (ko eba yazhi) to dangi ye zhi to dukiya nazhi ye kuyekan na to woce na ye sundan zunzunyana aga baye gan Soko to tuciu to kokari jin ta ekpa Soko-bo to eda zhi zhie har da kamina Sokoga'la umurni (foro)ndoci be na! Soko mae la jama'a yan fasiki zhi ke ekoa.
Surah 9:25   ,                   Assuredly Allah did help you in many battle-fields and on the day of Hunain: Behold! your great numbers elated you but they availed you naught: the land for all that it is wide did constrain you and ye turned back in retreat.,Hakika Soko jin ye taimako danna nazhi dokun nao to Efo Hunaynu kamina ekundo ye fe ya ye shaawa na uma kunke yaye wo be yandondo yin'a gancin ma kin cia yiku yaye bana ugwo dakan na gan cin yecia zunma zheta fe lo.
Surah 9:26,                 But Allah did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers and sent down forces which ye saw not: He punished the Unbelievers; thus doth He reward those without Faith.,Gancin Soko cia yangban shiu cin be ya tuciu to ya muminizhi uci cin ekun gun ci ndoci zhi be-yn na ye lea ye'a na uci jin zanazhia kafirinci jin na azaba wuncin ga ma yi egagba yan kafirizhio.
Surah 9:27 ,          Again will Allah after this turn (in mercy) to whom He will: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Gancin zunma wuncin'o Soko cia -- tuba yan zanaga ba'una Soko ma Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
Surah 9:28    ,                      O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not after this year of theirs approach the Sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty soon will Allah enrich you if He wills out of His bounty for Allah is All-knowing All-wise.,Ya ye nazhi imani jin na! Hakika mushirikizhi (nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na) Shikan ayio ebo acin'o aga kara ye ba masallaci Harami baci eya'a nanao ma. Ye ma gae sundan talauci to bele'yin Sokoa jin kunkunke yaye dagan mini arzikiubo uga bau na. Hakika Soko Etsu kpikpe UyioEtsu hikima Uyio.
Surah 9:29    ,                        Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger nor acknowledge the religion of Truth (even if they are) of the People of the Book until they pay the Jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued.,E gun zanazhie jin imani be Soko yin'ana to be Efozoba yin'ana ekun amae la yan na Soko be Tuci'u yin gaa lazhe haramu na haramua na amae jin adini yan gaskiya tsoa fi mini zanazhi ala litafi ya na har sai aga edu yan jizya ya be egwa'ayin ama' la'afe eza gbagbangizhi.
Surah 9:30  ,                    The Jews call ´Uzair a son of Allah and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah´s curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the Truth!,Ya huduzhi ma gan: uzairu egi Soko uyio" Nasarazhi ma gan: "Masihu egi Soko uyi" wuncin de egan'uyio nae dagan be misun'zhina. Amae san. La'ana Soko (kuti) ta eti abo! Ki-ila acie pan'a ke eko guru lugwao
Surah 9:31  ,                    They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of Allah and (they take as their Lord) Christ the son of Mary; yet they were commanded to worship but One Allah: there is no god but He. Praise and glory to Him: (Far is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him).,(Yahuduzhi) A' man yan'azhi la to (Nasarazhi) a man-yan'azhi la tsocizhi baci Soko acia Masihu egi maryamu la acinga.

Surah 9:32  ,            Fain would they extinguish Allah´s light with their mouths but Allah will not allow but that His light should be perfected even though the Unbelievers may detest (it).,E-wa gan a la haske-Soko'a nua ya be missun'zhi Soko mae navo sai de uga haske u gun-mi ka'a da ma kafiri zhi ga navo na.
Surah 9:33  ,           It is He Who hath sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth to proclaim it over all religion even though the Pagans may detest (it).,Wyun gayi Etsu na tun Tuci'u tun be bawu'ito be adini yan gaskiya yin'o na ebo ula wyun'u la'u ta eti Adinizhio kpata ka'a da ma mushrikunazhi (nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na ) ga navo na
Surah 9:34 ,                          O ye who believe! there are indeed many among the priests and anchorites who in Falsehood devour the substance of men and hinder (them) from the way of Allah. And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah: announce unto them a most grievous penalty-Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! ,Hakika kundondo dagan mini Ahbaruzhio (man yan yahuduzhi) to Ruhba nuzhi (man yan Nasarazhi) a jin'afe gi dukiya zazhi eti ganmanao ama'ajin afe kan zazhi eko Soko yin-da.

Surah 9:35 ,                 On the Day when heat will be produced out of that (wealth) in the fire of Hell and with it will be branded their foreheads their flanks and their backs their flanks and their backs.- "This is the (treasure) which ye buried for yourselves: taste ye then the (treasures) ye buried!",Fo na aga po'u ta eti dukiyao dan mini ena jahannamao na aci gau la'aba'a ye gun'azhio to kansan'azhio to zunma'azhio(acia fe gan'a gan):"Nana ga yi yanna ye tso ku yekan zhi-zhi ya eti tacin-yetso nao ebo acio'o efe fin azaba yan yannazhi yetso fe ku yekan (izheo na)
Surah 9:36  ,                                 The number of months in the sight of Allah is twelve (in a year)- so ordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are sacred: that is the straight usage. So wrong not yourselves therein and fight the Pagans all together as they fight you all together. But know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.,Hakika lisafi yan etswazhi (nadan eya ninio) eba Soko'o na uga yi etswa gu wo be guba yin'o kendoe uyi dan litafi Soko dagan fo-na ajin alitta sanmazhi to kin na miniabo ma gunni danbo nazhi yi Etswa alfurmazhi na.

Surah 9:36  ,                                 The number of months in the sight of Allah is twelve (in a year)- so ordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are sacred: that is the straight usage. So wrong not yourselves therein and fight the Pagans all together as they fight you all together. But know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.,Hakika lisafi yan etswazhi (nadan eya ninio) eba Soko'o na uga yi etswa gu wo be guba yin'o kendoe uyi dan litafi Soko dagan fo-na ajin alitta sanmazhi to kin na miniabo ma gunni danbo nazhi yi Etswa alfurmazhi na.

Surah 9:37  ,                            Verily the transposing (of a prohibited month) is an addition to Unbelief: the Unbelievers are led to wrong thereby: for they make it lawful one year and forbidden another year in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by Allah and make such forbidden ones lawful. The evil of their course seems pleasing to them. But Allah guideth not those who reject Faith.,Hakika de lila-lo yegboro (yan Etswa Alfurma) Na ye jin na bibe uyio dan mini kafirincio be wun cin'y ma zanazhi'ajin kafirinci na ela'agbin ke eko wangi lugwa :e'la etswa la'azhe halali eya-ndoci eyandoci ma u'u'la'azhe haramu ebo de ala emigun'a la'adan lisafi yane tswa na Soko lazhe haramu nao.

Surah 9:38 ,                          O ye who believe! what is the matter with you that when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah ye cling heavily to the earth Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter But little is the comfort of this life as compared with the Hereafter.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! ki'i jin ye yeo kandondo na aga gan ye gan: "E nakin gun kun ta eti ekpa Soko na "ye ajin yea nakanzhi lukpin kpe eti kinbo nao Kashi ye-yea ye dajin be eman edunfe izhe agan yan Efo zobaa Edunfe izhe ma ufe yandondo dan mini eku boa sai de te tengi.
Surah 9:39,               Unless ye go forth He will punish you with a grievous penalty and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For Allah hath power over all things.,Kagan ye dzu tinya da gunkun'a Sokoa jin'e azaba na tan na uma ga'a egwa-san la'adan'e be jama'a ndocizhi na jin ye yana (kinigibae bo) ye maa la egun ndondo tso'u woa. Soko ma Etsu uyio na de kagbo ta eti yan dondo na.
Surah 9:40 ,                                         If ye help not (your leader) (it is no matter): for Allah did indeed help him when the Unbelievers drove him out: he had no more than one companion; they two were in the cave and he said to his companion "Have no fear for Allah is with us": then Allah sent down His peace upon him and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights: for Allah is Exalted in might Wise.,Ka-gan ye jin'u taimakoa to hakika Soko'uujin taimako ni kamina kafiri zhi nyan'u dzun tinya uma yi zabaci yan zaguba kamina afi mini kpankoro na kamina ufe gan be masoyiu yin na: ga nyinyangban ma hakika Soko danbo be yi yin Soko cia yangban shi cin bea yau uci jin'u taimako be ekun gunci zhi na ye lea yea na ucia kalma yan kafiri zhi la'agba ci takotako kalma yan Soko ma ugayi elatu cio.

Surah 9:41 ,             Go ye forth (whether equipped) lightly or heavily and strive and struggle with your goods and your persons in the cause of Allah. That is best for you if ye (but) knew.,Yea nakin da ekunda kamina ka ya kun-yezhi ga yi finfanci na to kamin uga lukpin na ye mae jin jihadi be dukiya yezhi to be rayi yezhi dan mini eko Soko Wunci ga yi alheri ya yeyeo ye gafe zanazhi de kpikpe na.
Surah 9:42,                      If there had been immediate gain (in sight) and the journey easy they would (all) without doubt have followed thee but the distance was long (and weighed) on them. They would indeed swear by Allah "If we only could we should certainly have come out with you": They would destroy their own souls; for Allah doth know that they are certainly lying.,Da'aci gan ele na dan jihadio na u tso-tso ba ezan da na ma danbo na wun'ayi finfan ci uyio (ekun dondoa) aga mitu wyoe ammade wahala na danbo na wun'a lokpa fia.

Surah 9:43    ,        Allah give thee grace! why didst thou grant them until those who told the truth were seen by thee in a clear light and thou hadst proved the liars,Soko fa be lefi wyo-yin. Ki'ila wyo ci ya'a izini edun feo Har sia de eza gaskiya zhi ga'a tula wyo cia ganmana zun ci zhi kpe ye.
Surah 9:43     ,       Allah give thee grace! why didst thou grant them until those who told the truth were seen by thee in a clear light and thou hadst proved the liars,Soko fa be lefi wyo-yin. Ki'ila wyo ci ya'a izini edun feo Har sia de eza gaskiya zhi ga'a tula wyo cia ganmana zun ci zhi kpe ye.
Surah 9:44 ,            Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day ask thee for no exemption from fighting with their goods and persons. And Allah knoweth well those who do their duty.,Zanazhi ga imani jin be Sokoe to be Efo zobae na a'a wa izini wyoe ebo aga jin jihadi be dukiya'azhi to be rayia zhi ma'a Soko ma Etsu kpi kpe uyio yan zanazhi gae tswa'u amae sundan'u nao.
Surah 9:45   ,          Only those ask thee for exemption who believe not in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt so that they are tossed in their doubts to and fro.,Hakika de zanazhi wa izini wyoe (gan a y'a gunkun'ana) agayi zanazhi jin imani be Sokoe to be efo zoba yin'anao yangban'azhi mae jin kelo kezhin acia jin afe jin dalo-dazhin dan mini shakka'abo.
Surah 9:46    ,          If they had intended to come out they would certainly have made some preparation therefor; but Allah was averse to their being sent forth; so He made them lag behind and they were told "Sit ye among those who sit (inactive).",Da'acigan akpakpa gan a kpakpa aatinya (lo jihadi) da'atso ga tattali jin wangi. Soko ma navo na anakin na acia ekpin lu la'adan'a edunfeo. Aci gan'agan: "Efe fedun ganni be zanazhie fe dun nae.
Surah 9:47  ,              If they had come out with you they would not have added to your (strength) but only (made for) disorder hurrying to and fro in your midst and sowing sedition among you and there would have been some among you who would have listened to them. But Allah knoweth well those who do wrong.,Da'aci gan a tin tin ya dan mini yebo da'a beye be yandondo yin'a sai de eyan nyin da ama'a dinye be lila-lo yan kulo-kuzhin'y tsakani'ebo afe wa fitina za ya ye.

Surah 9:48,               Indeed they had plotted sedition before and upset matters for thee until- the Truth arrived and the Decree of Allah became manifest much to their disgust.,Hakika shidzo ba tsozhio a wa fitina za har ma a'alamari giye fi dozhi ya ya wyoe har ma gaskiya da be alamari Soko cia tula ama'a fe zanazhie navo na.
Surah 9:49,              Among them is (many) a man who says: "Grant me exemption and draw me not into trial." Have they not fallen into trial already and indeed Hell surrounds the Unbelievers (on all sides).Ama de dan miniabo na'ajin ugan gan: ,"Yami izini edunfe wyo mao ga la fitina tswanmi-ma."To ngan a ya gun fitina boani. Hakika ma ena yan jahanama ga kafirizhi ma kezhe.
Surah 9:50               If good befalls thee it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls thee they say "We took indeed our precautions beforehand" and they turn away rejoicing.Alheri ndoci ga'a de wyoe yangban'azhi gaa nyin masiba ndoci maga'de wyoe agan: "Hakika yi ya etswa waya ti tacin yi shidzo be'dzo. "Aci ga zunma zheta acia fe ma nin.
Surah 9:51 ,            Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector": and on Allah let the Believers put their trust.Gangan: ",Yandondoa tswan yi yia sai de yan na Soko ga ka ya yi na. wyunga yi Ndakata yi yio. Muminizhi ma ala'a kpeatso Soko.
Surah 9:52   ,                  Say: "Can you expect for us (any fate) other than one of two glorious things- (Martyrdom or victory) But we can expect for you either that Allah will send his punishment from Himself or by our hands. So wait (expectant); we too will wait with you.",Gancin: kashi ye tu yandoci ye tu ya yi ban be nini mini bolo bolo gubae (nasara ko tsu tsu eri) Yi tso mae tu ye ya ye gan Soko ula azaba ndoci'ube tswan ye dagan nkoubo koma be kagbo egwa yi yin. To ezhibo fe tu-ye hakika yi tso yi tsoe tu ye ganni be ye yin.
Surah 9:53 ,          Say: "Spend (for the cause) willingly or unwillingly: not from you will it be accepted: for ye are indeed a people rebellious and wicked.",Gangan: Efe wu dukiya ye zhi ko be ban'bae yin koma be ti'ile Soko dea gwo egwa ye boa. Hakika ye yeafe jama'a na zhi yi fasiki zhi na.
Surah 9:54 ,                    The only reasons why their contributions are not accepted are: that they reject Allah and His Messenger; that they come to prayer without earnestness; and that they offer contributions unwillingly.,Uma jin yan-docikan aci gwo dukiya nazhia wu na'ayin'a sai de ebona hakika a kafirinci jin be Sokoe to be Tuciuyin na be ma e'nakin da jin salla'a sai de be nakan gban'e a mae wu dukiya'a fi eko (Soko) boa sai de be nanvoe.
Surah 9:55,                Let not their wealth nor their (following in) sons dazzle thee: in reality Allah´s plan is to punish them with these things in this life and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of Allah.,Ebo acin'o ga lugwa dukiya'azhi to egiazhi ya wyoe shahawa ma. Hakika de Sokoe kpa-kpa gan wyun'U lau jin'a azaba edunfe-izheo rayi azhi ma'alaa gan bea yin alaali ma ayi kafirizhi.
Surah 9:56 ,        They swear by Allah that they are indeed of you; but they are not of you: yet they are afraid (to appear in their true colours).,Acie zhi kuti be Sokoe kede hakika mini yebo a dan'o na ala'alima ujin mini yebo adan'a. Ama'ade afe edansunci zhi.
Surah 9:57,          If they could find a place to flee to or caves or a place of concealment they would turn straightaway thereto with an obstinate rush.,Agade bandoci de na'abici lo na ko ma kpankorozhi ko ma bandoci na'da sogun na da aga zheban da ebau acia fe dinye.
Surah 9:58,               And among them are men who slander thee in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms: if they are given part thereof they are pleased but if not behold! they are indignant!,Amade dan miniabo nazhie gan-wyo-yin dan mini gingan sadakazhio na. Kamina aga twarya ya'a miniubo na afe fa yangban kagan ama twarya ya'a dagan miniuboa wyoa leaye aga zhewun.
Surah 9:59    ,              If only they had been content with what Allah and His Messenger gave them and had said "Sufficient unto us is Allah! Allah and His Messenger will soon give us of His bounty: to Allah do we turn our hopes!" (that would have been the right course).,Da'aci gan a yeda jin jin be yan na Soko be Tuciu yin la'aya'a na aci gan: Sokou kun'u ke'u yayi Soko ma'a yayi dagan mini arziki ubo to. Tuci'u (da wun'a fe alheri ya'a gan). Hakika yi lo eba Soko tsa yi'e bavun'o.
Surah 9:60   ,                  Alms are for the poor and the needy and those employed to administer the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: (thus is it) ordained by Allah and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.,Hakika de sadakazhim (yan zakka) yan talakazhi uyio to eza gwagbagizhi to zanazhie lo tun eti zakkao na to zanazhie ta'a yangbanzhi na to sisa wuzhi zhi to gbata gicizhi to dan mini ekpa Soko to ezhiloci na dzanna ga'agba na. Ti'ile uyio dagan eba Soko. Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 9:61 ,                        Among them are men who molest the Prophet and say "He is (all) ear." Say "He listens to what is best for you: he believes in Allah has faith in the Believers and is a Mercy to those of you who believe." But those who molest the Messenger will have a grievous penalty.,Amade dan miniabo nazhie jin Annabi gun na aciajin afe gangan: "Tukpa ko uyio" (wyun'e shi tukpa ko yan egan ndondo)! Gangan: " Tukpako yan alheri ya ye wyun'e jin imani be Sokoe uma yi yegun ya zanazhia imani jin mini yebo na. Zanazhi mae jin Tuci Soko gun na azaba na tan na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 9:62 ,          To you they swear by Allah. In order to please you: But it is more fitting that they should please Allah and His Messenger if they are Believers.,A'jin Afe zhi kuti yaye ebo ade ba'ade yade ye. Soko be Tuci'u yin ma aga -- yin na awa yedaa nao wun'ayi Muminizhi ayio na.
Surah 9:63  ,             Know they not that for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger is the Fire of Hell- wherein they shall dwell. That is the supreme disgrace.,Kashi a kpe kpea kede zandondo na gae le Soko ba be Tuci'u yin na kede hakika ena jahannama ga'ajin tabbata ya wyun'a Bagabo ama'afi tutunyin'o. Wuncin ma zunye sun uyio na gbota na.
Surah 9:64  ,              The Hypocrites are afraid lest a Sura should be sent down about them showing them what is (really passing) in their hearts. Say: "Mock ye! But verily Allah will bring to light all that ye fear (should be revealed).,Munafukizhie sundan na'acin sura ndoci be etiabo na'a ya'a labari yan yannazhi fi yangban'azhio na. Gangan: "Efe la'mide hakika Soko ga yan na ye sundan na la'a tinya.
Surah 9:65,            If thou dost question them they declare (with emphasis): "We were only talking idly and in play." Say: "Was it at Allah and His Signs and His Messenger that ye were mocking",Hakika ma wyo ga gbin'agan (ki-egan dan zunma bo) a'gangan: "Hakika de yie ba zayiba yicie dzodzo." Gangan: "Ngba Soko be ayauzhi be Tuci'u yin ga ye ela mio''
Surah 9:65,            If thou dost question them they declare (with emphasis): "We were only talking idly and in play." Say: "Was it at Allah and His Signs and His Messenger that ye were mocking",Hakika ma wyo ga gbin'agan (ki-egan dan zunma bo) a'gangan: "Hakika de yie ba zayiba yicie dzodzo." Gangan: "Ngba Soko be ayauzhi be Tuci'u yin ga ye ela mio''
Surah 9:66  ,             Make ye no excuses: ye have rejected Faith after ye had accepted it. If We pardon some of you We will punish others amongst you for that they are in sin.,Ega ta uzuri ndondo ma hakika ye ya ajin kafirinci baci na yea imani jin na. Yi ma ga'a fa be lefi zandocizhi mini ye bo Yi ga zandocizhi jin azaba ebo na hakika a'fe le fi jin cizhina.
Surah 9:67 ,                 The Hypocrites men and women (have an understanding) with each other: They enjoin evil and forbid what is just and are close with their hands. They have forgotten Allah; so He hath forgotten them. Verily the Hypocrites are rebellious and perverse.,Munafuki bagizhi to munafuki yinzagizhi zabadozhi ayio a'jin afe jin foro be eyan dede ama'jin afe kan etun guruzhi acie la egwa'azhi wa. A Soko batan eboacin'o Soko cia tso batan ga. Hakika munafukizhi agayi fasikizhio.
Surah 9:67  ,                The Hypocrites men and women (have an understanding) with each other: They enjoin evil and forbid what is just and are close with their hands. They have forgotten Allah; so He hath forgotten them. Verily the Hypocrites are rebellious and perverse.,Munafuki bagizhi to munafuki yinzagizhi zabadozhi ayio a'jin afe jin foro be eyan dede ama'jin afe kan etun guruzhi acie la egwa'azhi wa. A Soko batan eboacin'o Soko cia tso batan ga. Hakika munafukizhi agayi fasikizhio.
Surah 9:68   ,            Allah hath promised the Hypocrites men and women and the rejecters of Faith the fire of Hell: Therein shall they dwell: Sufficient is it for them: for them is the curse of Allah and an enduring punishment-,Soko jin munafuki bagizhi to munafuki yinzagizhi to kafirizhi alkawali yan ena jahannama bagabo afio tutun yin'o. Wyun' ga'a kun'akeo. Soko ma'a bo mi azaba na ma'a fedun na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 9:69   ,                            As in the case of those before you: they were mightier than you in power and more flourishing in wealth and children. They had their enjoyment of their portion: and ye have of yours as did those before you; and ye indulge in idle talk as they did. They!- their work are fruitless in this world and in the Hereafter and they will lose (all spiritual good).,Ke kotonci yan zanazhi shi yedzo na agbo'ka gan ye ama de dukiyazhi to egizhi gan ye aci wo ma be raboa yin yetso ma wo ma be rabo ye yin kendo zanazhi shiyedzo na wo ma be raboa yin na yema fe dzo izhe iri kendoe atso dzo izhe na.

Surah 9:70   ,                      Hath not the story reached them of those before them- the People of Noah and ´Ad and Thamud; the People of Abraham the men of Midian and the cities overthrown. To them came their messengers with clear signs. It is not Allah Who wrongs them but they wrong their own souls.,Beke labari zanazhi shidzo na be ya aa na jama'a yan Nuhuzhi to Aduzhi to Samuduzhi to jama'a yan Ibrahimazhi to zaba madyana to kin nazhi azhekpe na Tuci'azhi be ya'be bayanizhi. Umajin Soko jin'a zwaluncia ama'de atso tsa jin ti tacin'a zwaluncio
Surah 9:71  ,                     The Believers men and women are protectors one of another: they enjoin what is just and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers practise regular charity and obey Allah and His Messenger. On them will Allah pour His mercy: for Allah is Exalted in power Wise.,Mumini bagizhi to mumini yinzagizhi sashiazhi masoyizhi ayio ya sashi ejin foro be etun guruzhi a mae kan etu dedezhi amae ku sallah gikini amae wa zakka dukiya'azhi amae gba Soko be Tuci'u yin. Zawuncin zhi Sokoa gun'aye. Hakika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 9:72      ,                 Allah hath promised to Believers men and women gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein and beautiful mansions in gardens of everlasting bliss. But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of Allah: that is the supreme felicity.,Soko jin mumini bagizhi to mumini yinzagizhi alkawali wyun'a la'a gandan emi Aljannazhio nazhi sangizhie je fi takoabona ama'afibofi tutunyin be edunfe ba managizhi dan mini emi Aljannazhio ganni be yeda jin'y dagan eba Soko natso wancin ganna.

Surah 9:73,          O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the Hypocrites and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell- an evil refuge indeed.,Ya wyoe Annabi! Gun kafirizhi to munafikizhi kun wyo mao lao kuo gikini beayin be kagboe. Ezhekeba'a ma uga yi jahannamao. Bibi ma'ajin tabbata ya ezhe keba wuncin.
Surah 9:74,                                             They swear by Allah that they said nothing (evil) but indeed they uttered blasphemy and they did it after accepting Islam; and they meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out: this revenge of theirs was (their) only return for the bounty with which Allah and His Messenger had enriched them! If they repent it will be best for them; but if they turn back (to their evil ways) Allah will punish them with a grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter: They shall have none on earth to protect or help them.,A'jin a'fe zhi kuti be Sokoe ke agan'acin'a na alalima hakika agan gan yan kafirinci ama'ajin kafirinci baci musulunciabo ama jin kokari dan (wiwa) yan na a'de jin jin wun'a na (uga yi wuwu nae wagan a wu Annabi nao).

Surah 9:75,           Amongst them are men who made a covenant with Allah that if He bestowed on them of His bounty they would give (largely) in charity and be truly amongst those who are righteous.,A ma de miniabo najin Soko alkawali na Hakika Soko ga twarya yayi dagan mini falalaubo hakika yi yiajin sadaka hakika ma yi ga'fe da mini zaguruzhio.
Surah 9:76,        But when He did bestow of His bounty they became covetous and turned back (from their covenant) averse (from its fulfilment).,Kamina ubea la ya'a dagan mini falalaubo na acia yanbotan beuyin acia zunma zheta aciapanya ke shishe alkawali lugwa.
Surah 9:76  ,      But when He did bestow of His bounty they became covetous and turned back (from their covenant) averse (from its fulfilment).,Kamina ubea la ya'a dagan mini falalaubo na acia yanbotan beuyin acia zunma zheta aciapanya ke shishe alkawali lugwa.
Surah 9:77,              So He hath put as a consequence hypocrisy into their hearts (to last) till the Day whereon they shall meet Him: because they broke their covenant with Allah and because they lied (again and again).,Ucia zoba alamaria la'afe munafinci dan mini yangban'abo har da fo na aga be gun be uyin na ebo lenba yan alkawali na'ajin Soko na to ganmana nae zun nao.
Surah 9:78 ,         Know they not that Allah doth know their secret (thoughts) and their secret counsels and that Allah knoweth well all things unseen,Kashi ade kpikpe dea kede hakika Soko yibe kpikpe yan asiriazhi to egan swiswociazhia kede hakikama Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio yan yannazhia swokpata na'a.
Surah 9:79 ,                  Those who slander such of the believers as give themselves freely to (deeds of) charity as well as such as can find nothing to give except the fruits of their labour- and throw ridicule on them- Allah will throw back their ridicule on them: and they shall have a grievous penalty.,Zanazhie gangan dede (yan aibi) eti zanazhie lo tun alheri mini muminizhio ebo sadaka jin'o na to zanazhi de yan dondoa saide na'aga da jin kokari cide na (acie la'ajin sadaka na) gancin acie la'a mi Sokoa ga'agba be emi la'azhi azaba nama tan na wun'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 9:80,                        Whether thou ask for their forgiveness or not (their sin is unforgivable): if thou ask seventy times for their forgiveness Allah will not forgive them: because they have rejected Allah and His Messenger: and Allah guideth not those who are perversely rebellious.,Ka wyo ga ba gafara ya'a koma wyo ba gafara ya'a(ye ni uyio) ka wyo ga wa gafara ya'a zu adwani to Sokoa fa bea yin'a. Ebo na ajin kafirinci be Sokoe to be Tuci'u yin. Soko mae la fasikizhi ke eko gurua.
Surah 9:81,                          Those who were left behind (in the Tabuk expedition) rejoiced in their inaction behind the back of the Messenger of Allah: they hated to strive and fight with their goods and their persons in the cause of Allah: they said "Go not forth in the heat." Say "The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat." If only they could understand!,Zanazhia yadan zunmao na afa yangban be edun na'afe zunma yan Tuci Soko na ama navo na'ajin jihadi be dukiya'azhi to be rayiazhi dan eko Soko na aci gan: "Ega dzuntinya lo ekunda dan ba nawo yan yigidioma; Gangan: "Ngan ena jahannamam wona gan sarauyin."

Surah 9:82 ,      Let them laugh a little: much will they weep: a recompense for the (evil) that they do.,Ebo acin'o aga' man-tsan a'man-tsan degi ama'a tigi na dokun na wuncin mayi egagba yan woce dede nae ce na.
Surah 9:83,                        If then Allah bring thee back to any of them and they ask thy permission to come out (with thee) say: "Never shall ye come out with me nor fight an enemy with me: for ye preferred to sit inactive on the first occasion: Then sit ye (now) with those who lag behind.",To Soko ga bea wyo la zheban da eba jama'a ndocizhi miniabo aci wa izini be wyo yin yan tintinya to gangan: "yea tinya be mi yin'a har abada ye ma'a gun makiri ndondo kun be mi yin'a.

Surah 9:84 ,                Nor do thou ever pray for any of them that dies nor stand at his grave; for they rejected Allah and His Messenger and died in a state of perverse rebellion.,Wyo mao ga jin sallah ta eti ekun zaeni ndondo naga'a tsu na ma har abada wyo mao ga gikini eba kabari ubo ma. Hakika aajin kafirinci be Sokoe to be Tuci'u yin ama'a tsu alalima ayi fasikizhi.
Surah 9:85  ,             Nor let their wealth nor their (following in) sons dazzle thee: Allah´s plan is to punish them with these things in this world and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of Allah.,Dukiya'zhi ma to egiazhi aga ya wyoe sha'awa ma. Hakika de Sokoe kpa kpa gan wyun'a jin'a azaba jin be ayin dan izhe na nao rayiazhi ma'u la'ujin hallaka ala'alima ayi kafirizhi.
Surah 9:86  ,               When a Sura comes down enjoining them to believe in Allah and to strive and fight along with His Messenger those with wealth and influence among them ask thee for exemption and say: "Leave us (behind): we would be with those who sit (at home).",Gancin ma aga sura cinzhin kede: yea imani jin be Sokoe na ye mae jin jihadi ganni be Tuci'u yin. Zanazhi yi eza bagwozhi miniabo na afe wa izini wyoe acia gangan: A yi ya be zanazhi fedun zhizhi 9nbo) na.
Surah 9:87  ,        They prefer to be with (the women) who remain behind (at home): their hearts are sealed and so they understand not.,A yeda jin kede a zhia nbo ganni be inzagizhina. Acia yangbanzhi te ebo acin'o eganzhi cie yea bea.
Surah 9:88   ,          But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive and fight with their wealth and their persons: for them are (all) good things: and it is they who will prosper.,Amma'de Tuci (soko) to zanazhia imani jin be uyin na ajin jihadi (kokari ta eti ekpa Soko) be dukiyazhi to rayiazhi. Zawuncinzhi yi be egagba yan alherizhi za wuncinzhi ma agayi eza rabozhio.
Surah 9:89,            Allah hath prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein: that is the supreme felicity.,Soko jin shiri ya'a yan Aljannazhi na nuwan zhie je fi takoa bo na ama'a fibo tutunyin. Wuncin ga ma yi rabo na wancin nao.
Surah 9:90,                And there were among the desert Arabs (also) men who made excuses and came to claim exemption; and those who were false to Allah and His Messenger (merely) sat inactive. Soon will a grievous penalty seize the Unbelievers among them.,Zanazhi yi eza uzurizhi mini za banzunmazhio na cida be ebo ajin izinia ya'aa zanazhi ma zunwan ta Soko be Tuci'u yin na a fedun'a zhizhi.

Surah 9:91,                         There is no blame on those who are infirm or ill or who find no resources to spend (on the cause) if they are sincere (in duty) to Allah and His Messenger: no ground (of complaint) can there be against such as do right: and Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Le fi danbo ta eti eza gbogun zhi boa to guncizhi lefi ma ta eti zanazhi ade yan na'awu fi eko Soko ona'a aga yanagban'azhi tadzu ebo Soko be Tuci'u yin na'a. Le fi ndondo ma ta eti zanazhie jin bolobolona'a. Soko ma Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun.
Surah 9:92  ,                    Nor (is there blame) on those who came to thee to be provided with mounts and when thou saidst "I can find no mounts for you" they turned back their eyes streaming with tears of grief that they had no resources wherewith to provide the expenses.Lefi ma ta eti zanazhi kamina aga be eba wyoe ebo wyo yola yan Tucizhio ya'a wyoci gan: "Mide yanna mia la ye ta na'a" acia zheban ala'alima eyeazhie ya egiye ebo yangban nyin'o na ade yandondo na'a wu fi eko Soko boa nao.
Surah 9:93    ,              The ground (of complaint) is against such as claim exemption while they are rich. They prefer to stay with the (women) who remain behind: Allah hath sealed their hearts; so they know not (What they miss).,Hakika lefi ta eti za nazhie wa izini wyoe (ebo aga jin jihadi ma) ala'ali ma ayi eza bagwozhi na. Acia yeda jin gan a zhizhi (nbo) be inzagizhi Soko cia (haske) yangban'azhi ta ebo acin'o aci de kpikpea.
Surah 9:94   ,                          They will present their excuses to you when ye return to them. Say thou: "Present no excuses: we shall not believe you: Allah hath already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you: It is your actions that Allah and His Messenger will observe: in the end will ye be brought back to Him Who knoweth what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.",Afe la uzuri'azhi be eba ye kamina ye ga zheban da tsun'a na.

Surah 9:95  ,               They will swear to you by Allah when ye return to them that ye may leave them alone. So leave them alone: For they are an abomination and Hell is their dwelling-place-a fitting recompense for the (evil) that they did.,A'fezhi kuti ya ye be Sokoe kamina ye ga zheban da tsun'a na ebode ye lae dzun gan'abo to yea dzun gan'abo hakika shikan ayio ecin ba'a ma uga yi jahannamao wuncin ma yi egagba yan woce nazhie ce na.
Surah 9:96   ,          They will swear unto you that ye may be pleased with them but if ye are pleased with them Allah is not pleased with those who disobey.,A fe zhi kuti ya ye ebo de ye la yedae jin bea yin. Ka ye ga yeda jin bea yin to hakika Sokoe jin yeda be jama'a nazhi yi fasikizhi naa.
Surah 9:96  ,           They will swear unto you that ye may be pleased with them but if ye are pleased with them Allah is not pleased with those who disobey.,A fe zhi kuti ya ye ebo de ye la yedae jin bea yin. Ka ye ga yeda jin bea yin to hakika Sokoe jin yeda be jama'a nazhi yi fasikizhi naa.
Surah 9:97   ,            The Arabs of the desert are the worst in Unbelief and hypocrisy and most fitted to be in ignorance of the command which Allah hath sent down to His Messenger: But Allah is All-knowing All-Wise.,Eza banzunmazhi a gbo ka gan eba kafirinci jin'y be munafinci jin'y aga ma -- 'aci yin gan'o ebo na ade kpikpe yan hukuncizhi na Soko cin be ya Tuci'u naa. Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 9:98  ,             Some of the desert Arabs look upon their payments as a fine and watch for disasters for you: on them be the disaster of evil: for Allah is He That heareth and knoweth (all things).,Ama de dan mini eza banzunmazhio nazhie le yanna uga wu (fi eko Soko) na ye ke dashi na acia jin afe wa gan masibazhi a'laa cin'a dan ye cincin yan masibazhi eti atso bo wun'a tao.

Surah 9:99  ,                        But some of the desert Arabs believe in Allah and the Last Day and look on their payments as pious gifts bringing them nearer to Allah and obtaining the prayers of the Messenger. Aye indeed they bring them nearer (to Him): soon will Allah admit them to His Mercy: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Amade dan mini eza banzunmazhio na'a imani jin be Sokoe to be efo zobae na amae la yan nazhi aga wu na ke eyan tsonbazhi na ayio lo eba Soko umayi aduwa(yan salati) ya Tuci Soko na. Acin ga gao hakika ugaazhe tsonba ya'a be Sokoe Soko maga'a la gandan mini yegun'ubo. Hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 9:100    ,                    The vanguard (of Islam)- the first of those who forsook (their homes) and of those who gave them aid and (also) those who follow them in (all) good deeds- well-pleased is Allah with them as are they with Him: for them hath He prepared gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein for ever: that is the supreme felicity.,Zanazhi ma'a shidzo amayi za mafarizhi mini muhajiruzhio to ansaruzhi na to zanazhi la mitua zunmao be etun wangizhina Sokoa yeda jin bea yin atso ma'ajin be'Uyin. Umajin shiri ya'a yan Emi aljannazhi na nuwan zhie je dan takoubo na ama'a fi bo fi tutun yin. Wuncin ga yi rabo na wancin nao.
Surah 9:101 ,                    Certain of the desert Arabs round about you are hypocrites as well as (desert Arabs) among the Medina folk: they are obstinate in hypocrisy: thou knowest them not: We know them: twice shall We punish them: and in addition shall they be sent to a grievous penalty.,To dagan mini zanazhi maye -- ba mini banzunmacizhio na munafikizhi dan miniabo to mini za zhi-nin yan Madinao zanazhi gi gba ta eti munafuncio na dan bo wyoa kpea yea Yi tsa kpea yeo. Bele yin Yia jin'a azaba zu-guba gancin be acia la'a zheban'lo azaba natso wancin na.
Surah 9:102 ,               Others (there are who) have acknowledged their wrong-doings: they have mixed an act that was good with another that was evil. Perhaps Allah will turn unto them (in Mercy): for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,To ndocizhi ma danbo atsoa ye da jin be lefiazhi (a emi -- ) a etun wangi bokeba be ndoci nayi dede nae. Kengi uyio na Soko'agwo tuba jin'a na. Hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 9:103   ,            Of their goods take alms that so thou mightest purify and sanctify them; and pray on their behalf. Verily thy prayers are a source of security for them: And Allah is One Who heareth and knoweth.-- ,sadaka dagan mini dukiya'azhio wyo'olaadi wyo la'ao tadzu be'uyin. Wyo mae ba aduwao ya'a. Hakika aduwa wyo-zhi yangban cin ta uyio. Ya'ao. Soko ma Etsu nae wo yandondo na uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio.
Surah 9:104 ,              Know they not that Allah doth accept repentance from His votaries and receives their gifts of charity and that Allah is verily He the Oft-Returning Most Merciful,Kashi akpe-kpe gan Soko ga yi Etsu nae -- tuba dagan eba wuzhiu zhio na'a Umae -- to sadakazhia hakika ma soko Etsu Tuba uyio ma uyia'a
Surah 9:105,               And say: "Work (righteousness): Soon will Allah observe your work and His Messenger and the Believers: Soon will ye be brought back to the knower of what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.",Wyo mae gangan :Efe lo tun bele yin Sokoa le etun'e ye to Tuci (wun'a le ye ) to muninizhi gancin ma aga ye la'a zheban da eba Etsu na wun kpikpe yan naa'so na to na'a tula na gancin ucia ya ye labari etun nazhi ye lo na.
Surah 9:106     ,      There are (yet) others held in suspense for the command of Allah whether He will punish them or turn in mercy to them: and Allah is All-Knowing Wise.,To ndocizhi ma danbo nazhi epata ya hukunci Soko eti abona ko (uga bau) ujin'a azaba ko ma (wyun'a bau) ujin'a gafara. Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 9:107                ,       And there are those who put up a mosque by way of mischief and infidelity - to disunite the Believers - and in preparation for one who warred against Allah and His Messenger aforetime. They will indeed swear that their intention is nothing but good; But Allah doth declare that they are certainly liars.,Za nazhi ma'a masallaci la ebo egun jin'o na be kafirinci be gingan (kpere-kpere) tsakani musulumizhio na be esobae ya za nazhie gun Soko be Tuci'u yin ekun shido batsozhio na hakika ma a fe zhi kuti gan:"yide kpa yandondoa sai de alheri "ala'li ma sokoe jin ri ke hakika gan mana zuncizhi ayio na.
Surah 9:108    ,                  Never stand thou forth therein. There is a mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety; it is more worthy of the standing forth (for prayer) therein. In it are men who love to be purified; and Allah loveth those who make themselves pure.,Ga gikini (jin salla) miniabo ma har abada. Hakika masallaci na'a tu ta dansun Soko dagan caba efoe na uga -- yin gan na wyoe jin salla dan miniubo nao. Miniubo eza bagi ndocizhi danbo nazhie wa lili na hakika ma Soko ajin ufe wa eza lilicizhi.
Surah 9:109    ,                      Which then is best - he that layeth his foundation on piety to Allah and His good pleasure - or he that layeth his foundation on an undermined sand-cliff ready to crumble to pieces and it doth crumble to pieces with him into the fire of Hell. And Allah guideth not people that do wrong.,Ngba za na'a eba u tu ta eti dan sun Soko'o be wiwa yan yedau yin na uga de alheri gan'o-kashi za na la ba tu'u ta eti gushe misun'o nae wa gan wun'a banfi na Ucia banfi be wyun tsoe dan mini ena jahannamao. Soko mae la jama'a yan azwalumizhi ke eko gurua.
Surah 9:110   ,           The foundation of those who so build is never free from suspicion and shakiness in their hearts until their hearts are cut to pieces. And Allah is All-Knowing Wise.,Eba na'tu na wun'a la keyaboa uga'azhe eyan ke lo kezhin fi yangban'azhio har da kamina yangban'azhia bea sa ya na Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima.
Surah 9:111      ,                              Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth through the Law the Gospel and the Qur´an: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme.,Hakika Sokoa shi dagan eba muminizhio rayiazhi to dukiya'zhi ebo egagba aljanna na'a la ya'a na.

Ziima she alkawali wo agan Sokoo  Ebo acin'o efe fa yangban be Sokoe na. Wuncin ga ma yi rabo ba wancin nao.
Surah 9:112        ,       Those that turn (to Allah) in repentance; that serve Him and praise Him; that wander in devotion to the cause of Allah: that bow down and prostrate themselves in prayer; that enjoin good and forbid evil; and observe the limit set by Allah;- (These do rejoice). So proclaim the glad tidings to the Believers.,Za nazhie jin tuba na zanazhie jin bauta ya Soko na zanazhie jin yebo ya Soko na zanazhie fe azum na zanazhie jin rukuna zanazhie jin sujada na zanazhie jin dozhi foro be etun wangi na zanazhie kan etun dede na to za nazhie tswa iyaka Soko zhina. Wyo mao ya labari yangban fao ya Muminizhi.
Surah 9:113  ,                 It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should pray for forgiveness for Pagans even though they be of kin after it is clear to them that they are companions of the Fire.,Ugwo yin ya Annabi to zanazhia imani jin na'a na'aba gafara ya zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci na'a ka'a da ma agafe eza afe eza ena jahimuzhi na'a.
Surah 9:114      ,               And Abraham prayed for his father´s forgiveness only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allah he dissociated himself from him: for Abraham was most tender-hearted forbearing.Gafara na ma Ibrahima wa ya baba'una u fea sai de ebo alkawali ndoci na'ujin'una kamina ma ubea tula yau kede hakika (babau) wun'azhe makiri Soko na wyun'a egwau wa be uyio. Hakika Ibrahima za nae dokun be adwa jin nae uyio eza hakuri uyio.
Surah 9:115  ,               And Allah will not mislead a people after He hath guided them in order that He may make clear to them what to fear (and avoid)- for Allah hath knowledge of all things.,Soko ma wyun'e gbin jama'a ndondoa baci na uga'wuba na'a sai de uga bayani jin ya'bedzo yan yannazhi -- yin a tswa na. Hakika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio yan yandondo.
Surah 9:116 ,               Unto Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He giveth life and He taketh it. Except for Him ye have no protector nor helper.,Hakika Soko ga wun mulki sanmazhi to kin yin'o Wyun'e dan rayi umae wu rayi. Ye ma de zan doci baci soko na'a fe ndakata be taimako jinci ya ye na'a.
Surah 9:117 ,                         Allah turned with favour to the Prophet the Muhajirs and the Ansar- who followed him in a time of distress after that the hearts of a part of them had nearly swerved (from duty); but He turned to them (also): for He is unto them Most Kind Most Merciful.,Hakika Sokoa tuba yan Annabi gwo to muhajirunazhi (nazhi kpela dagan makao lo madina na ) to Ansaruzhi (madinacizhi) nazhia mi tu Annabi dan lokaci yan ezo'ona baci na yangban Zandoncizhi miniabo a tsoba na uga zhegba na gancin Soko ci gwo tuba'a . Hakika Soko Etsu tosayi Uyio Etsu yegun Uyio.
Surah 9:118  ,                            (He turned in mercy also) to the three who were left behind; (they felt guilty) to such a degree that the earth seemed constrained to them for all its spaciousness and their (very) souls seemed straitened to them- and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah (and no refuge) but to Himself. Then He turned to them that they might repent: for Allah is Oft-Returning Most Merciful.,Soko ma gwo tuba yan zaguta nazhia badan zunmaonahar ma kin (nana) wu'a pin'a bana ugwope da kan na rayi azhicia pin atso atso cia kpe wo kede edzunba ndondo danbo dagan eba Sokoboa saide be eban'zhe lo ebau na Gancin Soko ci gwa tuba'aebo ma ade ba'a la'a kua gikini be tuba jin'y. Hakika Soko Etsu nae -- tuba na uyio etsu yegun Uyio.
Surah 9:119 ,      O ye who believe! Fear Allah and be with those who are true (in word and deed).,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Etswa Soko ye mae sundan'u ye mae lae fe dan tacin eza gaskiya zhio.
Surah 9:120   ,                                                It was not fitting for the people of Medina and the Bedouin Arabs of the neighbourhood to refuse to follow Allah´s Messenger nor to prefer their own lives to his: because nothing could they suffer or do but was reckoned to their credit as a deed of righteousness- whether they suffered thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of Allah or trod paths to raise the ire of the Unbelievers or received any injury whatever from an enemy: for Allah suffereth not the reward to be lost of those who do good;-,Ugwo yin na jama'a yan Madinacizhi to za nazhi ma'a gwo ba dagan mini za banzunmazhio na na aga ce leba gbigba yan Tuci Soko na'a ama'aga wa rayiazhi agan rayiu ma. Wuncin ma yi ebo na nun-wo ndondo na ga woa na to wahala to madan naga gun'a dan eko Soko na be ezan ndondo na'aga da na'ala hankali kafirizhi nakin na saide egagba yan etun alheri ka ya'a. Hakika Soko wyun'e ta etun zaguruzhi yakpea.
Surah 9:121     ,            Nor could they spend anything (for the cause) - small or great- nor cut across a valley but the deed is inscribed to their credit: that Allah may requite their deed with the best (possible reward).,To yandondo na aga wu tetengi na to wanciko na'aga wu na to kpankoro na aga labici dana sai Soko ga la'ada ka yaa ebo Soko'u ga'agba be egagba na gyegan etu nazhi afe lo na.
Surah 9:122  ,                   Nor should the Believers all go forth together: if a contingent from every expedition remained behind they could devote themselves to studies in religion and admonish the people when they return to them- that thus they (may learn) to guard themselves (against evil).,Uma gwayin na Musulumizhi kpata ga tinya da ekunda na'a kia la acia de jama'a ndocizhi dagan mini kansan ndondo nazhia tinya da wa fahimta adini za'a naa yin'o Ebo ajin jama'a yan'azhi gangba kamina aga zheban lo eba'a na ujin wo be wuncin'y aga fe za nazhie tswa do ka Soko na.
Surah 9:123  ,             O ye who believe! fight the unbelievers who gird you about and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Egun kafiri nazhie tsoba ye na kun. Amaa tsun ye be kagboe ye mae kpe wo kede Soko wyun'ajin udanbe zanazhi gae tswaU acia sundan'u na.
Surah 9:124    ,             Whenever there cometh down a sura some of them say: "Which of you has had His faith increased by it" Yea those who believe- their faith is increased and they do rejoice.,Ama ga sura ndoci cin be ade dan miniabo na'ajin ugangan: "Ngba zi'i mini yebo (egan) nanazhi bea imanio To ammade zanazhia imani jin na ubea imaniamae fa yangban be uyio.
Surah 9:125 ,          But those in whose hearts is a disease- it will add doubt to their doubt and they will die in a state of Unbelief.,Amaade za nazhi batan fi yangban'azhio na ubea shikan be ta eti shikan'azhio acia tsu ala'ali ma ayi kafirizhi.
Surah 9:126   ,            See they not that they are tried every year once or twice Yet they turn not in repentance and they take no heed.,Kashi a'le ye le gan e'man 'acin le be fitinazhi mini eya ndondo; zunni koma zu guba'a Gancin ma e'jin tu'uba'a amae kpa yea.
Surah 9:126 ,              See they not that they are tried every year once or twice Yet they turn not in repentance and they take no heed.,Kashi a'le ye le gan e'man 'acin le be fitinazhi mini eya ndondo; zunni koma zu guba'a Gancin ma e'jin tu'uba'a amae kpa yea.
Surah 9:127     ,               Whenever there cometh down a Sura they look at each other (saying) "Doth anyone see you" Then they turn aside: Allah hath turned their hearts (from the light); for they are a people that understand not.,Kamina ma aga sura ndoci cin be na sashiazhi miniabo ciafe ba'ye cin sashi le (agan gan:) "Ngba ade zandoci nae le ye ye na Gancin aci ga zhe ban. Soko mae la yangban'azhi zhegba ebo na hakika afe jama'a nazhie de fahimta naa na.
Surah 9:128 ,            Now hath come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves: it grieves him that ye should perish: ardently anxious is he over you: to the Believers is he most kind and merciful.,Hakika Tuci be ya ye dagan mini yebo.
