Surah 63:1 ,                When the Hypocrites come to thee they say "We bear witness that thou art indeed the Messenger of Allah." Yea Allah knoweth that thou art indeed His Messenger and Allah beareth witness that the Hypocrites are indeed liars.,Kaminan Munafikizhi ga be eba wyo nan ajin'a gan gan: Yia eri jin ke akika Tuci Soko wo yio nan. Soko o tso kpe ke akika Tuci'u wo yio nan Soko o tso jin ri ke akika Munafikizhi ganmanan zunci zhi ayio nan.
Surah 63:2   ,        They have made their oaths a screen (for their misdeeds): thus they obstruct (men) from the Path of Allah: truly evil are their deeds.,(Munafikizhi a kuti nae zhi be sunna Sokoe na la ke garkuwa nan a cie la zawangizhi pan ya ke eko Soko lugwa akika etun nan munafikizhie lo nan wun'a biye
.Surah 63:3     ,     That is because they believed then they rejected Faith: So a seal was set on their hearts: therefore they understand not.,Wuncin ma yi ebo nan (Munafikizhi) a imani jin be misun'I acie lo tun yan kafirinci nan. Soko cia basira yangban'a te aci de fahimta yandondoa (sai yan etun dedezhi).
Surah 63:4  ,                   When thou lookest at them their exteriors please thee; and when they speak thou listenest to their words. They are as (worthless as hollow) pieces of timber propped up (unable to stand on their own). They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies; so beware of them. The curse of Allah be on them! How are they deluded (away from the Truth)!,(Munafikizhi) Wo ga lea ye nankan kpace'azhi a fe ya'o shahawa a man gae gan-gan wyo'ashi tukpa wo gan'a. ( Wo ga le'a ye kendoe a fedun fe zhi yegboro Annabio nan) Wyo'a ye gan ko cigbantun ayio nan a la kpetso nan. (Munafikizhi) ajin a fe kpaye gan kabara ndondo nan a ga yi nan etiabo a yi wun'o (wato ajin afe sundan gaskiya) za wuncinzhi ga yi akika yan makiyi (Soko be Tuciu yin'o) ebo acin'o e tswa'a Laana Soko ta etiabo. Kii la acie laa pan ya ke gaskiya lugwao
Surah 63:5 ,            And when it is said to them "Come the Messenger of Allah will pray for your forgiveness" they turn aside their heads and thou wouldst see them turning away their faces in arrogance.,A ma ga'e gan ya munafikizhi gan: e da be ebo Tuci Soko u wa gafara'u ya ye a ga etiazhi pan wo ma ale'a ye a ga pan ya ke eko Soko lugwa aci ga' gbotika (be aya Sokoe).
Surah 63:6     ,            It is equal to them whether thou pray for their forgiveness or not. Allah will not forgive them. Truly Allah guides not rebellious transgressors.,Daidai u yi etiabo ka wyo ga wa gafara ya ko ma wo'oga wa yaa ma Sokoa jin' gafara'a. Akika Soko wun'e la fasikizhi ke ekoa.
Surah 63:7    ,               They are the ones who say "Spend nothing on those who are with Allah´s Messenger to the end that they may disperse (and quit Medina)." But to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the Hypocrites understand not.,A (munafikizhi) ga yi za nanzhie gan gan: e ga la yangici ya za nanzhi dan eba Tuci Soko-onan ma har a la aga ya. Akika man arziki yan sanma kpata to kin eba Soko bo a dan'o ammaa de Munafikizhi a de fahimta alamari nan nan'a.
Surah 63:8  ,              They say "If we return to Medina surely the more honourable (element) will expel therefrom the meaner." But honour belongs to Allah and His Messenger and to the Believers; but the Hypocrites know not.,Aci fe gan gan: Yi ga kezhe daa zhinin yan Madina za nanzhi ga yi za cinwan cizhi nan a ga za gbagbangizhi yan tinya. Akika ma zankpe be cinwan'e wun'a jin tabbata ya Soko be Tuciu yin be Muminizhi amma'a de munafikizhi a de kpikpe akika nan na'a.
 Surah 63:9    ,            O ye who believe! Let not your riches or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. If any act thus the loss is their own.,Ye nanzhi a imani jin nan ega lugwa dukiya yezhi to egiezhi a ye jin shagala ke pipa yan Soko lugwa ma. Zaeni ndondo nan ga jin a cin nan za wuncin zhi ga yi eza asara zhio.
Surah 63:10   ,                 and spend something (in charity) out of the substance which We have bestowed on you before Death should come to any of you and he should say "O my Lord! why didst Thou not give me respite for a little while I should then have given (largely) in charity and I should have been one of the doers of good".,Ye mae wu dukiya yezhi nan Mi la ya ye nan (fi eko wangizhio) kafi ajali'u be'u la zaeni ndondo e nan. Ega lugwa sai efo ajali ga da be man. Ye cie fe gan gan Tsoci woa pata ya mi daa eka degi'a ebo min deba nla dukiya mizhi nku njin sadaka mi ma gaafe dan mini za guru zhio.
Surah 63:11 ,         But to no soul will Allah grant respite when the time appointed (for it) has come; and Allah is well acquainted with (all) that ye do.,Akika ma Soko wun'a pata ya rayi ndondoa kaminan efo ajali u ga'a tun na'a Akika Soko de labari etun nanzhi ye lo kpata nan.
