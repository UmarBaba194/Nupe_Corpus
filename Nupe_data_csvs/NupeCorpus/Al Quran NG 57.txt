Surah 57:19  ,                 And those who believe in Allah and His messengers- they are the Sincere (lovers of Truth) and the witnesses (who testify) in the eyes of their Lord: They shall have their Reward and their Light.

Here is a similitude: How rain and the growth which it brings forth delight (the hearts of) the tillers; soon it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then it becomes dry and crumbles away. But in the Hereafter is a Penalty severe (for the devotees of wrong). And Forgiveness from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure (for the devotees of Allah). And what is the life of this world but goods and chattels of deception,Ye kpe wo ke de edunfe izhe edzo uyio to shagala jin tsakaniebo be dozhi be wiwa yan bibe yan dukiyazhi be egizhiy ke kwatonkwoci ele nan uyio nan eyandzo'uzhi fe ya enunucizhi shiawa na gancin ucia bea wo wyo cia leu ye dzuru-dzuruy uci gazhe yan nan de anfa'ni bea nan.

But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves We did not prescribe for them: (We commanded) only the seeking for the Good Pleasure of Allah; but that they did not foster as they should have done. Yet We bestowed on those among them who believed their (due) reward but many of them are rebellious transgressors.,Yici kezhea Tuci Yizhi gba'a zunmao Yicia (Annabi) Isa egi Maryamu gbaa zunmao be Yicia Litafi yan Linjeela la'a yau Yicia tosayi be yegun'y laadan yangban yan za nanzhia emi tu'u nan.
