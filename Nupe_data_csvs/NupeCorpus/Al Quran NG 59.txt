Surah 59:1  ,         Whatever is in the heavens and on earth let it declare the Praises and Glory of Allah: for He is the Exalted in Might the Wise.,Yan nazhi fi sanmazhio nan to nanzhi fi kin bo nan kpata e li Soko tsatsa yin. Akika Soko Etsu zankpe u yio Etsu hikima Uyio.
Surah 59:2       ,                                It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces). Little did ye think that they would get out: And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But the (Wrath of) Allah came to them from quarters from which they little expected (it) and cast terror into their hearts so that they destroyed their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the Believers take warning then O ye with eyes (to see)!,Wun ga nyan kafirizhi mini zaba Litafizhi tin ya dagan emi'azhi bo ebo gungun yekan yan mafari bo. Ye yan ebankoazhi gaa a kangwa wo be Sokoe. Soko ci dzunfia banan akpaye tu'a nan. Ucia edo la'ace dan yangban'azhio atso ci fe ban emiazhi ya egwa'azhi ganni be egwa Muminizhiy e fe kpa ye re ya nanzhi yi eza hankali zhi nan.
Surah 59:3  ,           And had it not been that Allah had decreed banishment for them He would certainly have punished them in this world: And in the Hereafter they shall (certainly) have the Punishment of the Fire.,Kagan ujin ebo nan Sokoa nyin-nyan ka ta etiabo na'a da U gaa jin azaba dede izheo azaba yan ena maga' jin tabbata ya'a ekuo
Surah 59:4    ,       That is because they resisted Allah and His Messenger: and if any one resists Allah verily Allah is severe in Punishment.,Wuncin ma yi ebo nan a le Soko be Tuci'u yin ba nan zandondo na ma ga'a le Soko ba nan Soko Etsu tsun tsunnu u yio.
Surah 59:5     ,       Whether ye cut down (O ye Muslim!) The tender palm-trees or ye left them standing on their roots it was by leave of Allah and in order that He might cover with shame the rebellious transgresses.,Cigan ndondo nan ye ga nan ko ma ye ci'u ya gikini gbaro eti gbere'u bo nan sai de be izini yan Sokoe wuncin yi ebo u'la faskizhi'u sun zunye.
Surah 59:6    ,                    What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger (and taken away) from them - for this ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: but Allah gives power to His messengers over any He pleases: and Allah has power over all things.,Yan nan ma Soko ga nasara'u la'ucia ya Tuci'u mini (dukiya)kafirizhio nanye gun kun gunbe dokozhi ko ma yan-tuci ndoci boa akika Skoe la kagbo'u Tuci'u zhi ta eti iza nan ga bau nan Akika Soko de kangbo ta eti yandondo.
Surah 59:7        ,                            What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger (and taken away) from the people of the townships- belongs to Allah- to His Messenger and to kindred and orphans the needy and the wayfarer; In order that it may not (merely) make a circuit between the wealthy among you. So take what the Messenger assigns to you and deny yourselves that which he withholds from you. And fear Allah; for Allah is strict in Punishment.,Yan nan zhiy Soko ga nasarau la'a ya Tuciu mini alkaryazhio nan Soko wun dan miniu bo to Tuciu to za nanzhiy tsoba nan to ekungizhi to eza gwa gbagizhi to ezan daci ebo dukiya be'azhe yan nae dan yi dangwa ewodecizhio nama. Yandondo nan Tuci ga la cia ya ye nan ye'a emi tu'u yan nan ma u ga kan'e yin jin nan yea kpe ya beu yin ye mae fe sundan Soko akika Soko Etsu azaba nan gbota nan u yio.
Surah 59:8           ,      (Some part is due) to the indigent Muhajirs those who were expelled from their homes and their property while seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure and aiding Allah and His Messenger: such are indeed the sincere ones:-,(A ma kezhe'a la' ya) talakazhiy nanzhia kpela nan nanzhiy a nyan tinya ezhia zhio nan acia gan be dukiyazhiy nan. A'a jin afe wa eryatwa Soko be yedan yin za.A maajin a fe jin (Eko Soko) be Tuci'u yin taimako nan Akika za wuncinzhi ga yi za gaskiyazhio.
Surah 59:9       ,                       But those who before them had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith- show their affection to such as came to them for refuge and entertain no desire in their hearts for things given to the (latter) but give them preference over themselves even though poverty was their (own lot). And those saved from the covetousness of their own souls- they are the ones that achieve prosperity.,Zananzhiy ma fedun zhi nbo nan (Madinao) aci shiadzo naa a'jin a fe wa za nanzhi gaa kpela be tsun'a nan a mae de dukata ke dan yangban'azhio yan yan nanzhi a ga la ya'a amaajin afe tsa yegiazhi ta eti atsozhio kaa'ga yi be bukata yan yan wuncin'y zandomdo nan ga tswiswa la'adan yanbotan yan yangban'u bo nanakika zawuncinzhi ga yi za nanzhia de rabo nao.
Surah 59:10      ,                And those who came after them say: "Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who came before us into the Faith and leave not in our hearts rancour (or sense of injury) against those who have believed. Our Lord! Thou art indeed Full of Kindness Most Merciful.",Za nan zhiy ma be zunma'abo nan e gan gan: Tsoci yi jin yi gafara to yegi yizhinan zhia shi yidzo be imaniy nan Wyo mao ga la nanvo ndondo dan yangban yi bo lo'eba za nanzhia imani jin nan ma Tsoci yi akika Wyo ga yi Etsu tosayio Wyo ga yi Etsu yegun'o.
Surah 59:11       ,                    Hast thou not observed the Hypocrites say to their misbelieving brethren among the People of the Book - "If ye are expelled we too will go out with you and we will never hearken to any one in your affair; and if ye are attacked (in fight) we will help you". But Allah is witness that they are indeed liars.,Wyo le za nanzhiy jin manafunci nan ye'a E gan be yegiazhi nanzhia jin kafirinci mini za ba Litafi zhio nan gan: Wallahi a ga ye nyan tin ya yi tso ga tin ya ganni be ye yin yi maa la mi tu foro yan zandondo eti ye bo san san yin'a. A ma ga gun ye kun ye kun yia jin'e taimako. Akika Soko jin'ri ke ganmanan zuncizhi a yio nan.
Surah 59:12    ,           If they are expelled never will they go out with them; and if they are attacked (in fight) they will never help them; and if they do help them they will turn their backs; so they will receive no help.,Ka a ga nya tin ya a dzun tinya bea yin'a ka ama ga gun'a kun a jin'a taimakoa ka ama ga jin'a taimako a ga zunma zheta fe bici gancin a ma'a jin'a taimakoa.
Surah 59:13  ,         Of a truth ye are stronger (than they) because of the terror in their hearts (sent) by Allah. This is because they are men devoid of understanding.,Akika dansun ye u gbota gan dansun Soko fi yangban'azhio wuncin mayi ebo nan a de kpikpe wangia nan.
Surah 59:14      ,                They will not fight you (even) together except in fortified townships or from behind walls. Strong is their fighting (spirit) amongst themselves: thou wouldst think they were united but their hearts are divided: that is because they are a people devoid of wisdom.,A gun ye kun wo baeni boa sai de ezhi nanzhiy a ga dan gba nao ko ma zunmashin yan karazhio. Nanvo atso be dozhiy u gbota Sarauyin. (Wyo ga lea ye) Wyo'a ye gan ko kpaata'a nini a yio yangban'azhi ma kaka yin u yio wuncin ma yi ebo nan ade ankalia nan.
Surah 59:15   ,       Like those who lately preceded them they have tasted the evil result of their conduct; and (in the Hereafter there is) for them a grievous Penalty;-,A yi ke Misali yan za nanzhiy Shidzo tsoba nan a'azaba yan etun dede'azhi fin azaba nan ma tan nan wun'a jin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 59:16     ,           (Their allies deceived them) like the Evil One when he says to man "Deny Allah": but when (man) denies Allah (the Evil One) says "I am free of thee: I do fear Allah the Lord of the Worlds!",Ke misali yan Sheitan nan kaminan uga gan zawangi gan: A jin kafirinci nan"kamina uga kafirincin jin zo nan u gan: Egwa mi de dan beo yin'a akika mie sundan Soko nae kpa alittazhi kpata nan.
Surah 59:17         The end of both will be that they will go into the Fire dwelling therein for ever. Such is the reward of the wrong-doers.Zoba'azhi za gubaaba cia fe enao ama' fi bo fi tutunyin wuncin ga ma yi egagba yan azwalumizhio.
Surah 59:18 ,               O ye who believe! Fear Allah and let every soul look to what (provision) He has sent forth for the morrow. Yea fear Allah: for Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan e sundan Soko zandondo ma'u cin'ule'u lo yan nan uga lashidzo ya etiu ya esun alkiyamio nan ye mae sundan Soko akika Soko yi be labariy yan etun nanzhi ye lo nan.
Surah 59:19    ,     And be ye not like those who forgot Allah; and He made them forget their own souls! Such are the rebellious transgressors!,Ye mae ga'a fe ke dozhin za nanzhia Soko batan na ma ebo nan Soko jin'atso a eti tacin'atso batan. Akika za wuncinzhi ga yi fasikizhio.
Surah 59:20   ,      Not equal are the Companions of the Fire and the Companions of the Garden: it is the Companions of the Garden that will achieve Felicity.,Egi mi na zhi a jin ye ni be egi mi aljanna yin'a egi mi aljannazhi aga yi za nanzhia de robo nao.
Surah 59:21       ,          Had We sent down this Qur´an on a mountain verily thou wouldst have seen it humble itself and cleave asunder for fear of Allah. Such are the similitudes which We propound to men that they may reflect.,Da' aci gan eti pati bo Yi cin Alkuranu nan nan tao da wyo a le pati wuncin nan nan tao da wyo a le pati wuncin ye ugaa daku uci gaa la'fi ebo dansun Soko misali wuncin ma Yie la'u la wu zawangizhi ebo ko a kpa ye.
Surah 59:22      ,      Allah is He than Whom there is no other god;- Who knows (all things) both secret and open; He Most Gracious Most Merciful.,Soko ga yi Etsu nan a de tsoci ndocia sai Wun nao. Etsu nan de kpikpe yan na'a swo nan to na'a tula nan u yio Etsu rahma Etsu yegun.
Surah 59:23  ,                Allah is He than Whom there is no other god;- the Sovereign the Holy One the Source of Peace (and Perfection) the Guardian of Faith the Preserver of Safety the Exalted in Might the Irresistible the Supreme: Glory to Allah! (High is He) above the partners they attribute to Him.,Soko ga yi Etsu nan a de tsoci ndocia sai Wun nao Etsu mulki Etsu lili Etsu aminci Etsu nae yedan yandondo nan Etsu zankpe Etsu Tiile Etsu cinwan. Lili kpata'ajin tabbata ya Soko ke ya nanzhie la pau baci nan lugwa.
Surah 59:24    ,            He is Allah the Creator the Evolver the Bestower of Forms (or Colours). To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names: whatever is in the heavens and on earth doth declare His Praises and Glory: and He is the Exalted in Might the Wise.,Wun ga yi Soko nae jin alitta nao Etsu nae tswa yan zhi nan Etsu nae la nankankpace ya alittazhi nan Etsu nan yi be sunna wangizhi nan. Yan nanzhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo nan e li'u tsatsayin Wun ga yi Etsu zan kpe o Etsu hikima.
