Surah 58:1       ,           Allah has indeed heard (and accepted) the statement of the woman who pleads with thee concerning her husband and carries her complaint (in prayer) to Allah: and Allah (always) hears the arguments between both sides among you: for Allah hears and sees (all things).,Akika Soko wo gan yan eza ynzagi nae gan lo gan-zhin be wyo yin eti egan eba'u bo nan. Ucie jin kara lo eba Soko. Soko mae wo eza yezhi. Akika Soko Etsu nae wo gan nan uyio Etsu nae le ba ye nan uyio.
Surah 58:2    ,                  If any men among you divorce their wives by Zihar (calling them mothers) they cannot be their mothers: None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth. And in fact they use words (both) iniquitous and false: but truly Allah is one that blots out (sins) and forgives (again and again),.Za nanzhie jin zihari mini yebo be yinmiazhiy nan (aajin afe'la yinmin'azhi san tatu be nna'azhi nna'zhi yan akika a ga yi nanzhiy ma'a nao. Akika a de gan gan dedezhi tinya misun'o a mae zun ganmanan zun. Akika Soko Etsu sauki uyio Etsu gafara uyio.
Surah 58:3         ,           But those who divorce their wives by Zihar then wish to go back on the words they uttered- (It is ordained that such a one) should free a slave before they touch each other: Thus are ye admonished to perform: and Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.,Za nanzhiy ma ga zihari jin be yinmiazhiy nan acia jin ake dazhin eti egan na'gan nan( ke uyi acin'a na) hukunci nan ta etiabo nan u ga yi gan a la wuzhi a ya gi shidzo kafi a la egwa'atu yinmiazhi nan. Wuncin ga yi yan nan e la jin ye waazi nao Soko ma yi be Labari yan etun nanzhi ye lo kpata nan.
Surah 58:4          ,               And if any has not (the wherewithal) he should fast for two months consecutively before they touch each other. But if any is unable to do so he should feed sixty indigent ones this that ye may show your faith in Allah and His Messenger. Those are limits (set by) Allah. For those who reject (Him) there is a grievous Penalty.,Gancin za nan be dewuzhia nan u la azum yan etswa guba nanzhiy lamitu dozhi nan'u fe kafi'u la egwa'u tu yinmiu nan. Gancin zanan be jin wuncin woa nan u la eza gwagbagizhi za shita'u ya yan'u gi. Wuncin ma yi ebo ye la imanie jin be Soko be Tuci'u yin iyaka (to hukunci) yan Soko zhi ga dan'o nao azaba na ma tan nan wun'ajin tabbata ya kafirizhi.
Surah 58:5  ,               Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be humbled to dust as were those before them: for We have already sent down Clear Signs. And the Unbelievers (will have) a humiliating Penalty-,Akika za nanzhie le Soko be Tuciu yin ba nan a ga'a gba kendoe za nanazhiy shiadzo nan gba nan akika Yi'a aya nanzhi tula nan cin bea ya wye akika ma azaba yan zun yesun a jin tabbata ya kafirizhi.
Surah 58:6        ,      On the Day that Allah will raise them all up (again) and show them the Truth (and meaning) of their conduct. Allah has reckoned its (value) though they may have forgotten it for Allah is Witness to all things.,Fo nan Soko ga'a na'akin baenio nan wun'a ya' labari yan etun nanzhiy a lo nan Soko'u gwo tswa a ma'a batan akika Sokoe jin eri eti yandondo.
Surah 58:7         ,                                     Seest thou not that Allah doth know (all) that is in the heavens and on earth There is not a secret consultation between three but He makes the fourth among them - Nor between five but He makes the sixth- nor between fewer nor more but He is in their midst wheresoever they be: In the end will He tell them the truth of their conduct on the Day of Judgment. For Allah has full knowledge of all things.,Kashi wyo le ye gan Soko kpikpe yan yannanzhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo na'a A de eza swiswoci tsakani za guta boa sai de Soko gaa fe nicia a maa yi za gutsun Soko gaafe tswanayin cia ka aga gbagba gan'acin ko aci gan'acin sai Wun'a dan gancin Ucia'ya'a labari yan etun nanzhi a lo nan efo alkiyamiy. Akika Soko de kpikpe yan yandondo.
Surah 58:8          ,                           Turnest thou not thy sight towards those who were forbidden secret counsels yet revert to that which they were forbidden (to do) And they hold secret counsels among themselves for iniquity and hostility and disobedience to the Messenger. And when they come to thee they salute thee not as Allah salutes thee (but in crooked ways): And they say to themselves "Why does not Allah punish us for our words" Enough for them is Hell: In it will they burn and evil is that destination!,Ngba Wyo le za nanzhi a kan'a gan a aga baza swiswoci na ma ye'a Gancin aci kezhe eti yannan akan'a gan a ga jin na ma a cie baza swiswoci eti le fio be gbin gbin tuy be lemba yan Tuciy.

Surah 58:9  ,                O ye who believe! When ye hold secret counsel do it not for iniquity and hostility and disobedience to the Prophet; but do it for righteousness and self-restraint; and fear Allah to Whom ye shall be brought back.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan kami nan ye ga'a baza swiswoci nan e ga baza eti le fio be gbingintuy be lemba Tuciy ma e baza eti emi latu Soko be dansun Sokoe yemae fe tswa Soko Etsu nan eba'u ga ye'a kezhe lo nan.
Surah 58:10 ,               Secret counsels are only (inspired) by the Evil One in order that he may cause grief to the Believers; but he cannot harm them in the least except as Allah permits; and on Allah let the Believers put their trust.,Akika ezabaswiswoci (eti lefio) dagan eba Sheitan bo wun'e fe beo ebo yangban yan zananzhia imani jin nan ula'u nyin u ma jin'a egun ndondo woa sai be izini Sokoe Soko ga ma Muminizhi a ya kpe kawan yin'o.
Surah 58:11     ,                        O ye who believe! When ye are told to make room in the assemblies (spread out and) make room: (ample) room will Allah provide for you. And when ye are told to rise up rise up Allah will rise up to (suitable) ranks (and degrees) those of you who believe and who have been granted (mystic) Knowledge. And Allah is well-acquainted with all ye do.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan a ga gan ye gan ye; kpe ba'e ya'a edunfe bao e kpe ba ya'a Soko akpe ba ya yetso ga. A ma ga gan ye gan: e nakin (eti etun Soko) ye'a nakin Soko ga za nanzhiy ga imani jin miniebo nan latu to za nanzhiy yi be kpikpe' nan Wun'a yaa darajazhi Soko ma yi be labari yan etun nanzhi ye lo nan.
Surah 58:12       ,              O ye who believe! When ye consult the Messenger in private spend something in charity before your private consultation. That will be best for you and most conducive to purity (of conduct). But if ye find not (the wherewithal) Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan kami nan ye ga'baza be Tuciy nan ye'a sadaka la'a shidzo be-dzo. Wuncin ga yi alheri ya ye yeo u ma tadzu gan. Kagan ye be de'a akika Soko Etsu gafara u yio Etsu yegun u yio.
Surah 58:13         ,              Is it that ye are afraid of spending sums in charity before your private consultation (with him) If then ye do not so and Allah forgives you then (at least) establish regular prayer; practise regular charity; and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.,Kashiy ye sundan sun (yan yaji) ye ga sadaka la'a Shidzo kafi ye baza nan Kagan ye be jin'a Soko cia fa be ye yin yea swallah ku gikini ye mae la zakkae wa ye mae la mietu Soko be Tuci uyio akika Soko de labari etun nanzhiy ye lo nan.
Surah 58:14       ,           Turnest thou not thy attention to those who turn (in friendship) to such as have the Wrath of Allah upon them They are neither of you nor of them and they swear to falsehood knowingly.,Ngba Wyo le za nanzhi'a jama'a nan zhi Soko a zhe wun be yin nan la ndakatazhi nan ye'a Za wuncinzhi a dan mini ye boa a ma dan mini'a boa. A ma'ajin a fe zhi kuti eti gan manao a tso ma kpe.
Surah 58:15  ,       Allah has prepared for them a severe Penalty: evil indeed are their deeds.,Sokoa shiri yan azaba nan tan nan jin ka'a akika etun nanzhiy e lo nan wun'a bi ye.
Surah 58:16      ,   They have made their oaths a screen (for their misdeeds): thus they obstruct (men) from the Path of Allah: therefore shall they have a humiliating Penalty.,A' kuti nanzhiy e zhi nan la ke garkuwa nan acia eko Soko kan'eza yn da azaba yan zunyesun wun'a jin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 58:17    ,          Of no profit whatever to them against Allah will be their riches nor their sons: they will be Companions of the Fire to dwell therein (for aye)!,Duki-yaazhi to egizhi a' kunke ya'be yandondoe eba Soko boa. Zawuncinzhi ma a ga yi egi mi na zhio ba ga bo a fi tu tun yin'o.
Surah 58:18   ,             One day will Allah raise them all up (for Judgment): then will they swear to Him as they swear to you: And they think that they have something (to stand upon). No indeed! they are but liars!,Fo nan Soko gaa ku nankin bae nio nan acia fe zhi kuti ya'u kendoe e zhi kuti ya ye nan acia fe kpaye gan eti yandoci (nan gboka nan) bo a tao A'a ujin'acin'a akika ganmanan zuncizhi a yio.
Surah 58:19  ,            The Evil One has got the better of them: so he has made them lose the remembrance of Allah. They are the Party of the Evil One. Truly it is the Party of the Evil One that will perish!,Sheitan'yin'a rukpea U cia tanba yan pipa Soko la'a ce taa za wuncizhi ga yi jama'a yan sheitan zhio akika ma jama'a yan sheitan ga yi eza hasarazhio.
Surah 58:20    ,   Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be among those most humiliated.,Akika za nanzhie le Soko be Tuci'u yin ba nan a ga yi eza gbigbaci zhio.
Surah 58:21  ,      Allah has decreed: "It is I and My messengers who must prevail": For Allah is One full of strength able to enforce His Will.,Sokoe hukunci ba gan akika Mi ga de (galaba) zankpe to Mi to Tuci Mizhi. Akika Soko Etsu kagbo u yio Etsu zankpe u yio.
Surah 58:22  ,                                                Thou wilt not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day loving those who resist Allah and His Messenger even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. For such He has written Faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow to dwell therein (for ever). Allah will be well pleased with them and they with Him. They are the Party of Allah. Truly it is the Party of Allah that will achieve Felicity.,Wyo'a tsun jama'a nanzhia imani jin be Sokoe be efo zobae nan a fe de cincin ya za nae le Soko be Tuci'u yin ba na'a ka agafe mimaazhi ko egiazhi ko yegiazhi ko dangiazhi.
