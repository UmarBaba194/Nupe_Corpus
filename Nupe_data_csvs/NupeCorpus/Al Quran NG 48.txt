Surah 48:1  ,   Verily We have granted thee a manifest Victory:,Akika yi ga kpe eko (alheri) zhi ya wyo yo ekokpe nantsoa tula nan. thee thy faults of the past and those to follow; fulfil His favour to thee; and guide thee on the Straight Way;Ebo Soko'u deba'o fa be wyo yin yan zunbi wyozhi nazhi'a shidzo nan to nazhi ke wyo'a be jin-nan U ma'u la ni'ima' uzhi'u shekpan'uta eti wyo bo Uma'u wu wyo ba yan eko nantso yi gboro nan.
Surah 48:2    ,          That Allah may forgive thee thy faults of the past and those to follow; fulfil His favour to thee; and guide thee on the Straight Way;,Ebo Soko'u deba'o fa be wyo yin yan zunbi wyozhi nazhi'a shidzo nan to nazhi ke wyo'a be jin-nan U ma'u la ni'ima' uzhi'u shekpan'uta eti wyo bo Uma'u wu wyo ba yan eko nantso yi gboro nan.
Surah 48:3  , And that Allah may help thee with powerful help.,Soko ma' ajin'o taimako taimako nantso'a zankpe nan.
Surah 48:4    ,              It is He Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the Believers that they may add faith to their faith;- for to Allah belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom;-,Wun ga yi Etsu nan cin yangban tacin be dan yangban Muminizhi bo nan ebo a de ba'abe imani'a be imani'a kagbocizhi kpata yan sanmazhi to yan kin Soko wun'a o akika Soko ma'afe Etsu nan yibe kpikpe yan'dondoe nan Etsu hikima.
Surah 48:5      ,            That He may admit the men and women who believe to Gardens beneath which rivers flow to dwell therein for aye and remove their ills from them;- and that is in the sight of Allah the highest achievement (for man)-,Ebo'u la mumini bagizhi to mumini ynzagizhi u gan'u dan aljannazhio nanzhiy nuwanzhie je fi taakoabo na ama'a fibo fi tutun yin u ma ga etun dedeazhi kpata fin'ya wuncin ma'afe rabo nan wancin ana.
Surah 48:6     ,               And that He may punish the Hypocrites men and women and the Polytheists men and women who imagine an evil opinion of Allah. On them is a round of Evil: the Wrath of Allah is on them: He has cursed them and got Hell ready for them: and evil is it for a destination.,Uma'u la munafiki bagizhi to munafikiynzagizhi to bagi nazhie la yan pa Soko baci nan' to yinzagi nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na u jin azaba za nazhie kpa-ye dede be Sokoe nan hallaka gaajin tabbata ta etia bo Soko ma'a zhe-wunbeayin uma kuti bu kpea u ma'enan yan jahannama jin shiri yaa akika zobaazhi maa biye.
Surah 48:7   ,    For to Allah belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom.,Kagbocizhi kpata yan samazhi to kin Soko wun'o akika Soko ma'afe Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima.
Surah 48:8  ,  We have truly sent thee as a witness as a bringer of Glad Tidings and as a Warner:,Akika yi ya wyo tun tun wyo la'o fe za naajin ri nan to za nae ya labari yangban fa nan to za nae jin gangba nan.
Surah 48:9      , In order that ye (O men) may believe in Allah and His Messenger that ye may assist and honour Him and celebrate His praise morning and evening.,Ebo acin'o ye'a imani jin be Sokoe to be tuciu yin ye mae jin'u taimako ye mae fe li'u tsa tsa yin to lazhin to lozun.
Surah 48:10 ,                       Verily those who plight their fealty to thee do no less than plight their fealty to Allah: the Hand of Allah is over their hands: then any one who violates his oath does so to the harm of his own soul and any one who fulfils what he has covenanted with Allah- Allah will soon grant him a great Reward.,Akika za nazhie jin mubaya'a (zunmatu yan baeni) be wyo yin nan akika Soko tsa ajin mubaya'a beyin'o yin nan akika Soko ta eti egwa'azhio gancin za nan ga alkawali'u lo'ya nan eti taci'u tsa'u jin gun'o zaeni ndondo na ma ga yan nan wun'ajin Soko alkawali nan she nan Soko ayau lada nan wancin nan.
Surah 48:11   ,                                 The desert Arabs who lagged behind will say to thee: "We were engaged in (looking after) our flocks and herds and our families: do thou then ask forgiveness for us." They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: "Who then has any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with Allah if His Will is to give you some loss or to give you some profit But Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do.,Bele'yin za nazhiy yi za zunmazhi na (nanzhi dzunda gunkun'ana) mini larubawa laticizhio na a gan gan: 'dukiya yizhi to iyali yizhi a yi jin shagala wyo ga jin'oba gafara ya yi.

Surah 48:12   ,                "Nay ye thought that the Messenger and the Believers would never return to their families; this seemed pleasing in your hearts and ye conceived an evil thought for ye are a people lost (in wickedness).",U jin acin'a ye de fe kpaye-kpa gan tuci Soko to miminizhi (a ga tinya da ekun da) a aka'ra de eba iyaliazhi zhin bea sheitan ma'wuncin panin fi yangban yezhio ye ci fe kpa-ye dede zhi yecia'afe eza hallakazhi.
Surah 48:13    ,    And if any believe not in Allah and His Messenger We have prepared for those who reject Allah a Blazing Fire!,Zaeni ndondo na ma ya Soko be tuci'u yin gaskiyaa nan da akika yi jin shiri yan azaba ena sa'iru ya kafirizhi.
Surah 48:14    ,         To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills: but Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Soko ga wun mulki yan sanmazhi to kin yin'o fe be za nan ga ba'u nan Umae jin za na bau na azaba. Akika Soko a fe Etsu gafara Etsu yegun.
Surah 48:15      ,                        Those who lagged behind (will say) when ye (are free to) march and take booty (in war): "Permit us to follow you." They wish to change Allah´s decree: Say: "Not thus will ye follow us: Allah has already declared (this) beforehand": then they will say "But ye are jealous of us." Nay but little do they understand (such things).,Beleyin eza zunma wuncinzhi a gan gan kamina nan ye gae lo gani ma (arziki yan ekun) zhi'yn kuzhi nan "e lugwa yi la mitu ye yiy" e wa gan'a la egan Soko a zhe gba.

Surah 48:16  ,                         Say to the desert Arabs who lagged behind: "Ye shall be summoned (to fight) against a people given to vehement war: then shall ye fight or they shall submit. Then if ye show obedience Allah will grant you a goodly reward but if ye turn back as ye did before He will punish you with a grievous Penalty.",Gan ya za nazhi yi za zunmazhi mini larubawa laticizhio nan; Bele yin a be yi ye lo eba jama'a ndocizhinanzhiy gboka sarawyin nan ebo ye dae gun'a kun ko ma a la lo musulunci ye ga mitu foro nan nan Sokoa yae laa da nayi wangi naye ma ga zunma zheta kendoe ye kayn jin shidzo batsozhi na Wun'a jin'e azaba nan tan sarauyin anan.
Surah 48:17 ,                         No blame is there on the blind nor is there blame on the lame nor on one ill (if he joins not the war): But he that obeys Allah and his Messenger- (Allah) will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and he who turns back (Allah) will punish him with a grievous Penalty.,Leifi ta eti yebonci boa (kagan ulo ekun daa na'a) to za nan de bicia nan boa. Zaeni ndondo nan ga mitu Soko to Tuciu nan u ga'u laagandan aljannazhio nan nuwanzie je fi takoshin'u bo nan za ndondo na ma ga zunma zheta nan Wun'a jin'u azaba nan tan sarayin nan.
Surah 48:18  ,                Allah´s Good Pleasure was on the Believers when they swore Fealty to thee under the Tree: He knew what was in their hearts and He sent down Tranquillity to them; and He rewarded them with a speedy Victory;Akika Soko'a yeda jin be Muminizhiy kami nan afe jin mubaya'a be wyo yin eshin yan cigban'o nan Soko ma kpe yannanzhiy fi yangban'a bo nan Uci ci yangban tacin be yaa Ucin kezhe ya'a nasara nan tsoba nan.
Surah 48:19 ,     And many gains will they acquire (besides): and Allah is Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom.,Ganni be ganimazhiy' nan dokun nan na'ade nan Soko ma'afe Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima.
Surah 48:20    ,             Allah has promised you many gains that ye shall acquire and He has given you these beforehand; and He has restrained the hands of men from you; that it may be a Sign for the Believers and that He may guide you to a Straight Path;,Soko ma kezhe jin ye alkawali ndoci yan ganima nan ye'a de nan u cia nan nan fan fi ye U maa kun ke ya ye be ekun zawangizhiy ebo ula'ufe a ya ' u ya Muminizhi U ma'u wu ye ba'u lo eko nantso yi gborona.
Surah 48:21   ,          And other gains (there are) which are not within your power but which Allah has compassed: and Allah has power over all things.,To ndoci nan ye kunke wo ta etiaboa Nan akika Soko ama kezhe. Akika Soko ma de kagbo taeti yandon
Surah 48:22   ,        If the Unbelievers should fight you they would certainly turn their backs; then would they find neither protector nor helper.,Da aci gan kafirizhi ga gun ye kun gun daa bici gancin ma aade Ndakata'a amaa de taimako jincia.
Surah 48:23    ,       (Such has been) the practice (approved) of Allah already in the past: no change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of Allah.,Nan nan ma ekpa yan Soko u yio nan -- gan ta eti zananzhiy shidzo nao. Wyo ma'a de egbazhe ndondo dan ekpa Soko boa.
Surah 48:24     ,             And it is He Who has restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makka after that He gave you the victory over them. And Allah sees well all that ye do.,Wun ga yi za nan kangwa ekun 'azhi ya ye yeo nan U ci kangwa ekun ye ya atso'o zhinin yan Makabo baci nan wun'a ye la'a ta eti boani nao. Akika Soko a fe Etsu nae cin'ye le dan etun ndondo na ye gae lo nao.
Surah 48:25      ,                                 They are the ones who denied Revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the sacrificial animals detained from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom ye did not know that ye were trampling down and on whose account a crime would have accrued to you without (your) knowledge (Allah would have allowed you to force your way but He held back your hands) that He may admit to His Mercy whom He will. If they had been apart We should certainly have punished the Unbelievers among them with a grievous Punishment.,A ga yi za nanzhi ajin kafirinci nao acia ye kan gingandan yan Masallaci Harami nan to Hadayaotso aci u kanta a lugwa utun dannan wun'a. Kagan ujin ebo bagi Mumini ndocizhi to ynzagi Mumina ndocizhi boa nanzhiy-ma ye kpe'aye'a naa yin'a ebo ye be'a wu mimacinle ndoci be tswan ye ebo'abo ye ma kpea ma Soko ma jin'acin jin ebo u la za nan ga bau nan'U gan'u dan mini yegun'u bo. Da aci gan zawuncizhi akpe kayin kpe da Yiga kafirizhi mini-abo jin azaba nan tan sarauyin nan.
Surah 48:26        ,                   While the Unbelievers got up in their hearts heat and cant - the heat and cant of ignorance- Allah sent down His Tranquillity to his Messenger and to the Believers and made them stick close to the command of self-restraint; and well were they entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allah has full knowledge of all things.,Kami nan kafirizhia egya yan nanvo la'afi yangban'a zhio nan egya yan nanvo na ma yi yan jahiliyyah nan (eza'ti zhkozhi) Soko cia yangbanshi'u cin be ya Tuci'u to Muminizhi Ucia egan yan dansun Soko la'a gboka ya'a. Ama'afe shi'ubo a ga gwou'yin'o aga mayi zaba wun'o. Akika Soko yi be kpikpe yandondoe
Surah 48:27    ,                       Truly did Allah fulfil the vision for His Messenger: ye shall enter the Sacred Mosque if Allah wills with minds secure heads shaved hair cut short and without fear. For He knew what ye knew not and He granted besides this a speedy victory.,Akika Soko'a gaskiya nan dan enana yan Tuciubo nan la'awu'u be gaskiyae ke de ye ga gandan Masallaci Haramio nan U gaa ba Soko nan be aminciy ganni be ma'ade dansun yan dondoa soko ma kpikpe yannazhi ye-de kpikpea na Ucia nasara nantsoba nan la'gba zunma wunma.
Surah 48:28          ,   It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth to proclaim it over all religion: and enough is Allah for a Witness.,Soko ga tun Tuci'u tun be bawuy ganni be adini yan gaskiya yin'o ebo u la wun'u la'u ta eti adini ndocizhio baenio. Akika Soko maa akunke yan Eri.
Surah 48:29         ,                                            Muhammad is the messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer) seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade then makes it strong; it then becomes thick and it stands on its own stem (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness and a great Reward.,(Annabi) Muhammadu Tuci Soko U yio za nazhi ma a gaskiya ya beu yin nan a gboka ama zwo lo eba kafirizhi a ma yi eza yegunzhi tsakani atso be dozhiy wyo'a le'a ye e'lo ruku'u a nae lo sujada e wa arziki za dagan eba Soko be yedau yin alamazhi dan fuskaazhio ebo ekundo yan sujadazhio kendoe a yiyi ga nan dan'o nao iriazhi madan mini Ataurao amade iriazhi dan mini Injeelao aafe ke edzo na'gwalagi uzhi laa tin ya nanaci kezhe fe gbo'uka be har maa a lekpan acia jin daidai ta'eti gbereabo Ucie ya enu nucizhi sha'wa ebo ma kafirizhi a Zhewun'agan pa'yin.
