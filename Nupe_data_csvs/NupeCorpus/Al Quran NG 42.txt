Surah 42:1 ,Ha-Mim,HEU MIM
Surah 42:2,´Ain. Sin. ,Qaf.AIN SIN KAF (Bayanizhi shidzo eti iri aya nanzhiy boa ni. Egwa wu ma' ayio yan zankpe yan kpikpe Soko nan'ude ta eti alittazhio nan).
Surah 42:3   ,      Thus doth (He) send inspiration to thee as (He did) to those before thee- Allah Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom.,Acinga ga Soko Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima wun'e jin wahayi be ya wyo yao to zanazhiy shi wyo dzo nao.
Surah 42:4 ,        To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: and He is Most High Most Great.,Wyun ga wun yannanzhiy fi sanmazhio to nanzhiy fi kin bo nao wun ga ma yi Etsu elatuo Etsu cinwan'o
.Surah 42:5    ,              The heavens are almost rent asunder from above them (by Him Glory): and the angels celebrate the Praises of their Lord and pray for forgiveness for (all) beings on earth: Behold! Verily Allah is He the Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Sanmazhi atsotso ke a ga banfi dagan fitio nan (ebo edo yan cinwan Soko) Malaikazhi mae li Soko be ekundo yan yebo jin'y ya Tsocia yin amae kezhe ba gaafara ya za nanzhiy fi kinbo nan. Akika Soko ga yi Etsu gaafarao U ga ma yi Etsu yegun'o.
Surah 42:6   ,        And those who take as protectors others besides Him- Allah doth watch over them; and thou art not the disposer of their affairs.,Za nanzhiy ma a zandocizhi la ndakata ke Soko lugwa nan kpikpe yan Soko ta etiabo wyo ma jin za na'a fe tswa etun'azhi za na'a.
Surah 42:7   ,                  Thus have We sent by inspiration to thee an Arabic Qur´an: that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities and all around her- and warn (them) of the Day of Assembly of which there is no doubt: (when) some will be in the Garden and some in the Blazing Fire.,Acinga ga Yi jin wahayi Alkuranu be ya wye yo u ma yi be ezhimi Larubawae ebo wyo yo jin jama'a yan Makacizhi gangba to za nanzhiy ma'u kezhe nan (izhe kpata). Wyo mao jin'a gangba eti efo gun-gun yekan wanciko kelo kezhin ndondo dan boa jama'a sashizhi a fi Aljannao jamaa sashizhi maa fi enan yan sa'iruo.
Surah 42:8        ,          If Allah had so willed He could have made them a single people; but He admits whom He will to His Mercy; and the Wrong-doers will have no protector nor helper.,Wun'a ba Soko ba da uga zawangizhi laazhe al'umma nini (eti adini ninio) amma'de wun'e la za nan ga bau nan a gandan mini yegun'u bo. Azwalumizhi ma a de eya'a a ma de za na'ajin'a taimako naa.
Surah 42:9  ,             What! Have they taken (for worship) protectors besides Him But it is Allah- He is the Protector and it is He Who gives life to the dead: It is He Who has power over all things,Kashi a zandocizhi la la ndakatazhi zunma Soko Ngan Soko ga yi Ndakata yan gaskiyao wun ga ma'edan eyan tsutsu cizhi rayio U ma de kagbo ta eti yandondo
Surah 42:10   ,           Whatever it be wherein ye differ the decision thereof is with Allah: such is Allah my Lord: In Him I trust and to Him I turn.,Yandondo nan ma ye ga cedozhi leba etiubo nan Ye'a hukunci la aya Soko (ebo nan wun ga wun hukunci kpatao). Soko wuncin ga yi Tsoci mi yin'o wun ga mi ya kpeo eba'u ga ma mia zheban loo.
Surah 42:11      ,            (He is) the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is nothing whatever like unto Him and He is the One that hears and sees (all things).,Soko ga yi Etsu nan jin alitta sanmazhi to kin nao. Wun'a yinzagizhi jin ya ye dagan mini nankan yetso to dabbazhiotso wun'ajin eba be yiwozhiy. Wun'ejin alitta yezhi dokun fi mini eba be yiwo zhiy. Akika ade yandoci dozhin Sokoa Etsu u ma yio nae wo gan nan Etsu nae le bandondo ye nan.
Surah 42:12   ,         To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: He enlarges and restricts. The Sustenance to whom He will: for He knows full well all things.,Giyeko yan edzunba ko yan arziki yan sanmazhi to kin dan ba'ubo wun'e kpe gwa arziki ya za nan ga ba'unan U mae la de'gi ya za nan ga ba'u nan. Akika Soko de kpikpe yan yandondo.
Surah 42:13               ,                      The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which We enjoined on Abraham Moses and Jesus: Namely that ye should remain steadfast in religion and make no divisions therein: to those who worship other things than Allah hard is the (way) to which thou callest them. Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him).,Sokoa sharia la cici ya ye yan adini iri nantso u lajin wahayi be ya (Annabi) Nuhu nan to nantso Yi jin wahayiu be ya wye nan to yan Ibrahima to Musa to Isa kpaata'a Yi jin'a wasiyya gan: Ye'a adini ku gikini Ye mae ga sa'kpazhi be dozhi dan mini adinio ma. Yan nan wyo'e la yi kafirizhi gan abe'a tsun nan wun'a lukpin fia. Soko ajin u tsa za nan ga bau nan zhin ekou. U mae la za nan ga'zheban zhin ebau-nan ke eko gboro.
Surah 42:14  ,                           And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them- through selfish envy as between themselves. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord (tending) to a Term appointed the matter would have been settled between them: But truly those who have inherited the Book after them are in suspicious (disquieting) doubt concerning it.,A ma kpe ka-ka-yin be dozhi yin'a sai de baci nan kpikpe da be yaa zo nan ebo nanvo nandan tsakaniabo be dozhiy nan. Ka'ujin ebo hukunci Tsoci naa shidzoa ni uci pata yaa da kandoci yegboro na'a da'aga hukunci ba tsakaniabo be dozhiy. Akika za nanzhiy gi'gun yan Litafi zunma'abo nan e'jin kelokezhin (dan alamari adinio).
Surah 42:15        ,                         Now then for that (reason) call (them to the Faith) and stand steadfast as thou art commanded nor follow thou their vain desires; but say: "I believe in the Book which Allah has sent down; and I am commanded to judge justly between you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord: for us (is the responsibility for) our deeds and for you for your deeds. There is no contention between us and you. Allah will bring us together and to Him is (our) Final Goal.,Ebo acin'o fe yi zazhi (zhin eko Soko) Wyo mao laoku'o gikini kendoe Soko jin'o foro nan ga la'mi tu etun yangban'azhi ma. Gan gan: mia gaskiya ya be Litafi nanzhi Soko cin beyin nan a ma jin mi foro gan mi'n tswa adalci (gboro da) tsakani ye bo. Soko ga yi Tsoci yi yio to yan ye yeo egagba yan etun yizhi yi ga wun'o nyan ye tso ma ye ga wun'o emigbo ndondo dan tsakani yi bo be ye yin'a Soko ga yi ku yekan baenio ebau gabo ma ezhekeba dan'o.
Surah 42:16           ,      But those who dispute concerning Allah after He has been accepted- futile is their dispute in the Sight of their Lord: on them will be a Penalty terrible.,Za nanzhiy mae gbomi eti alamari Soko nan baci nan ekundondo zawangizhi a imani jin beu yin'a ni nan hujja yan zawuncinzhi nyi-nyi ci uyio eba Tsociabo ewunzhe yan Soko maajin tabbata ta etiabo azaba nan tan sarauyin nan wun'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 42:17   ,       It is Allah Who has sent down the Book in Truth and the Balance (by which to weigh conduct). And what will make thee realise that perhaps the Hour is close at hand,Soko ga yi Etsu nancin Litafi be be gaskiyae nao ganni be tsunwan yan gboro dae. Kiy maala kpikpe ya wyo yo ko Alkiyami a tsoba kpan kpan yin'a nio
Surah 42:18     ,                Only those wish to hasten it who believe not in it: those who believe hold it in awe and know that it is the Truth. Behold verily those that dispute concerning the Hour are far astray.,Za nanzhiy a jin imani beu yin'a nan e'din Alkiyami ye za nanzhiy ma imani jin beu yin nan e sundan'u a ma kpe wo ke gaskiya uyio nan. Akika za nanzhie jin kelo kezhin eti Alkiyamio nan a fi mini egbin naa kpe ya nan.
Surah 42:19  ,      Gracious is Allah to His servants: He gives Sustenance to whom He pleases: and He has power and can carry out His Will.,Soko Etsu yegun uyio be wuzhi'uzhiy wyun'e la arziki ya za na ga bau nan. Akika Etsu kagbo uyio Etsu zankpe Uyio.
Surah 42:20 ,                    To any that desires the tilth of the Hereafter We give increase in his tilth and to any that desires the tilth of this world We grant somewhat thereof but he has no share or lot in the Hereafter.,Zandondo nae lo tun ucie wa egagba yan Alkiyami nan Yia be'u bibe dan mini egagba'ubo za nan ma gae lo tun ebo egagba izheo nan Yia yau mini'ubo u maa de rabo ndondo efo alkiyami yin'a.
Surah 42:21   ,                  What! have they partners (in godhead) who have established for them some religion without the permission of Allah Had it not been for the Decree of Judgment the matter would have been decided between them (at once). But verily the Wrong-doers will have a grievous Penalty.,Kashi a de Tsoci ndocizhi de (baci Soko) nan la sharia cici yaa yan adini natso ma Soko yaa izini wun'a nan Akika kagan u jin ebo nan hukunci Soko a shidzoani naa da aga hukunci ba tsakani'abo (tun dagan izhe babo) Akika azaba nan tan nan wun'ajin tabbata ya azwalumizhi.
Surah 42:22  ,                     Thou wilt see the Wrong-doers in fear on account of what they have earned and (the burden of) that must (necessarily) fall on them. But those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in the luxuriant meads of the Gardens: they shall have before their Lord all that they wish for. That will indeed be the magnificent Bounty (of Allah).,Wyo'a le azwalumizhi ye a fe sundan yan egagba ded yan etun nanzhiy a lo nan U ma ga cin taa. Zananzhi maa imani jin acie lotun guru nan a fi mini bata Aljannazhio yannanzhi a gae wa kpata nan u dan be Tsocia yin. Nan nan ga yi daraja nan wancin nao.
Surah 42:23      ,                      That is (the Bounty) whereof Allah gives Glad Tidings to His Servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say: "No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin." And if any one earns any good We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Ready to appreciate (service).,Nan nan ga Sokoe la' fa wuzhi'uzhi yangban'o nanzhia imani jin amae lotun wangizhi nan Gan gan: Mi gbin ye gan egagba (yan etun nan mie lo nan boa) sai de cincin yan dangibo ( nan dan tsakani'abo nan). Zaeni ndondo nan ga lo tun wangi nan Yi'a be'u bolobolo dan mini'ubo. Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu nan e jin yebo nan uyio.
Surah 42:24    ,                 What! Do they say "He has forged a falsehood against Allah" But if Allah willed He could seal up thy heart. And Allah blots out Vanity and proves the Truth by His Words. For He knows well the secrets of all hearts.,Kashiy e gan-agn ganmanan u zun ta Soko Ngan Wun'aba Soko ba uga eyan te yangban wye Soko ma ga ganmana finya u ma ga gaskiya jin tabbata be hukunciuyin akika ude kpikpe yan yannazhi fi yangbanzhio nan.
Surah 42:25   ,        He is the One that accepts repentance from His Servants and forgives sins: and He knows all that ye do.,U mae gwo gwatan (tuba) yan wuzhi u zhi U mae fa be etun dedezhiy U ma de kpikpe yan etun nazhiy ye" lo na.
Surah 42:26     ,      And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness and gives them increase of His Bounty: but for the Unbelievers their is a terrible Penalty.,U mae gwo aduwa za nazhi ga imani jin acie lo tun wangizhi na U maa bea mini eryatwa'ubo. Kafirizhi ma azaba tsuntsun gaajin tabbata ya'a
Surah 42:27       ,         If Allah were to enlarge the provision for His Servants they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth; but he sends (it) down in due measure as He pleases. For He is with His Servants Well-acquainted Watchful.,Da'aci gan Soka ariziki kpegwa kpe ya wuzhiuzhi baenio da'aga gbotika kpe eti kinbo (aga'gwo iyaka gan) amma'de Wyun'e cin'u cin be gwargwado yan kendoe ga bau na. Akika Soko de labari yan na wuzhi uzhi fi'y ninbo na U mae cin'a le.
Surah 42:28  ,          He is the One that sends down rain (even) after (men) have given up all hope and scatters His Mercy (far and wide). And He is the Protector Worthy of all Praise.,Wyun ga mae du le be ya ao baci nan a ga kauna ba nao. Umaela yegun'u twarya yaa. Akika Wun ga yi Ndakatao Etsu nan yandondo e jin yebo ya nan.
Surah 42:29      ,         And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the living creatures that He has scattered through them: and He has power to gather them together when He wills.,U ma dan mini 'ayau zhio jinjin yan sanmazhi be kin yin to dabba nazhi ga fi bonan Uma de iko nan Uga'ku'a yekan nan ka mina u ga bau nan.
Surah 42:30   ,      Whatever misfortune happens to you is because on the things your hands have wrought and for many (of them) He grants forgiveness.,Yandondo nama ga tswan ye mini yan masi-bazhio nan etun dede yan egwa ye tso zhi ga din'u beo U mae fa be etun dede nazhi dokun nan.
Surah 42:31       ,      Nor can ye frustrate (aught) (fleeing) through the earth; nor have ye besides Allah any one to protect or to help.,Ye maa gan'gwa kin boa ye ma de Ndakata a gwo Soko gan'a ye ma de taimako jinci a gan wun'a.
Surah 42:32   ,  And among His Signs are the ships smooth-running through the ocean (tall) as mountains.,U dan mini a 'ya uzhio eya nuwan nazhie je kpe eti eduzhio nan (wyo'a le a ye ba kpako) a yi ke patizhi nan.
Surah 42:33 ,             If it be His Will He can still the Wind: then would they become motionless on the back of the (ocean). Verily in this are Signs for everyone who patiently perseveres and is grateful.,U ga bau uga efe kan gikini eyazhi kpata ci ga'kan ta ta eti eduo. Akika mini wuncin'o aya danbo ya zandondo na gae jin hakuri ucie jin yebo ya Soko nan.
Surah 42:34   ,   Or He can cause them to perish because of the (evil) which (the men) have earned; but much doth He forgive.,Ko ma wun'a jin hallaka ebo dede nazhi a lo nan. U mae fa be nan dokun nae.
Surah 42:35     ,   But let those know who dispute about Our Signs that there is for them no way of escape.,Za nazhiy mae gbomi dan mini aya Yizhio na atso ga'kpe (foga) gan a de bandonbo nan a bici lo naa.
Surah 42:36,                Whatever ye are given (here) is (but) a convenience of this life: but that which is with Allah is better and more lasting: (it is) for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord:,Akika yan dondo nan (Soko) ga la ya ye nan eman wo u yio teten-gi yan izhe natso dan be Sokoe nan ude alhei gan u ma fedun gan ya za nanzhiy ga imani jin amaa yakpe Tsocia nan.
Surah 42:37  ,       Those who avoid the greater crimes and shameful deeds and when they are angry even then forgive;,To za nanzhi e kpe ya be zunubi wancikozhiy to etun sakpazhiy nan a ma'ga a jin fushi a'jin a fa nan.
Surah 42:38   ,       Those who hearken to their Lord and establish regular Prayer; who (conduct) their affairs by mutual Consultation; who spend out of what We bestow on them for Sustenance;,To za nazhi e ye yiyi yan Tsocianan a mae kursalla gikini nan alamariazhi ma eti sha'wara bo ejin wun'o nan a maekezhe wu dukiy'a-'zhi (fi eko wangio) mini arziki nanzhi Yi la yaa nan.
Surah 42:39,     And those who when an oppressive wrong is inflicted on them (are not cowed but) help and defend themselves.,To za nazhiy zwalunci ga tswan'a a jin'a wa taimako eti jin jin gao) nan .
Surah 42:40        ,     The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto (in degree): but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation his reward is due from Allah: for (Allah) loveth not those who do wrong.,Egagba yan etun dede ma dede iri dozhin'u. Za nan ma gabea fa nan uci jin bolobolo nan ladau dan eba Soko akika Sokoe wa azwalumizhia.
Surah 42:41  ,      But indeed if any do help and defend themselves after a wrong (done) to them against such there is no cause of blame.,Zanan ma gaa jin ga baci nan u jin zwalunci nan zawuncinzhi lefi ndondota etia boa
Surah 42:42 ,             The blame is only against those who oppress men and wrong-doing and insolently transgress beyond bounds through the land defying right and justice: for such there will be a penalty grievous.,Akika lefi ta eti za nazhie jin zawangizhi zw-alunci nao a cie gwo iyaaka gan kpe eti kinbo umajin eti gaskiya boa nan. Akika za wuncinzhi azaba nan tan wuncinzhi tabbata ya'a.
Surah 42:43 ,      But indeed if any show patience and forgive that would truly be an exercise of courageous will and resolution in the conduct of affairs.,Za nan ma ga ankuri jin u ci fa nan akika wuncin dan mini alamari nan zhiy gbota nao.
Surah 42:44       ,            For any whom Allah leaves astray there is no protector thereafter. And thou wilt see the Wrong-doers when in sight of the Penalty Say: "Is there any way (to effect) a return",Zaeni ndondo na Soko ga u gbin nan wun'ade ndakata ndoci zunma'u boa wyo ma'ale azwalumizhi ye kami nan aga le azaba ye nan acia fe gan ga'n: Ngba yi ade kafa ndoci be nan yi ga'zheban da izhe na'a
Surah 42:45     ,                     And thou wilt see them brought forward to the (Penalty) in a humble frame of mind because of (their) disgrace (and) looking with a stealthy glance. And the Believers will say: "Those are indeed in loss who have given to perdition their own selves and those belonging to them on the Day of Judgment. Behold! Truly the Wrong-doers are in a lasting Penalty!",Wyo ma'a lea ye afe'kua tu yi kpe eti enao aci gaa gba a ga'sunzunye a fe yi ba yi cinle. Za nazhiy a imani jin nan ci gan:Akika eza asarazhiy aga yi za nanzhiy ajin asara yan etitacin'azhio to yan iyaliazhi efo Alkiyami nao Akika azwalumizhi a fi mini azaba na'a kugikini nao.
Surah 42:46   ,            And no protectors have they to help them other than Allah. And for any whom Allah leaves to stray there is no way (to the Goal).,Amaa de ndakatazhi nazhi'a jin'a taimako baci Soko naa. Akika zandondo nan Soko ga u gbin nan Wun'a ke eko bea.
Surah 42:47     ,               Hearken ye to your Lord before there come a Day which there will be no putting back because of (the Ordainment of) Allah! that Day there will be for you no place of refuge nor will there be for you any room for denial (of your sins)!,Efe ye yiyi yan Tso'ci ye shidzo kafi efo nan wun'a ye dagwa yaa nan u be dagan eba Soko' na. Ye'a de eswoba ndodo fo wuncin'a a maade zandondo nan'a gbo mi naa.
Surah 42:48      ,                    If then they run away We have not sent thee as a guard over them. Thy duty is but to convey (the Message). And truly when We give man a taste of a Mercy from Ourselves he doth exult thereat but when some ill happens to him on account of the deeds which his hands have sent forth truly then is man ungrateful!,Gancin a ga zunma zheta Yi tun'wyo fia gan wyo yo feo tswa'ao za'a. Yan wyo de u ga yi eyan wuo. Kami nan Yi ga yegun yi la'a ya zawangi degi na wun'afe jin alfahri beu Yin kamina ma eyan dede gaa tswan'a ebo etun dede azhio nan akika kanga zawangi ga cin mannabo be Sokoe.
Surah 42:49     ,         To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills (and plans). He bestows (children) male or female according to His Will (and Plan),Mulki yan sanmazhi to kin Soko wun'o Wun'ejin yan na ga bau nan Wun'e twarya ynzagizhi ya za nan ga bau nan U mea twarya bagizhi ya za nan ga bau nan.
Surah 42:50  ,        Or He bestows both males and females and He leaves barren whom He will: for He is full of Knowledge and Power.,Ko ma wun'a zhin keba bagizhi to ynzagizhi za nan ma ga bau nan wun'u ya raama gbasan'yn (wun'a degi ndondo ma'a) akika Etsu kpikpe u yio Etsu iko.
Surah 42:51        ,             It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration or from behind a veil or by the sending of a messenger to reveal with Allah´s permission what Allah wills: for He is Most High Most Wise.,U ma gwo Yin na a gan gan Soko gan gan be alita ndondoe naa (eye be eye) saide be wahayiy ko ma zunmata yan yekan ndocio ko ma wun'a tun Tuci tun ucia jin wahayi yau be izini'u yin yan yannan ga bau na akika Etsu elatu u yio Egba u yio.
Surah 42:52         ,                 And thus have We by Our Command sent inspiration to thee: thou knewest not (before) what was Revelation and what was Faith; but We have made the (Qur´an) a Light wherewith We guide such of Our servants as We will; and verily thou dost guide (men) to the Straight Way-,Acinga ga Yijin wahayi be ya wye yan Alkuranu dagan foro yi bo zunma ba tsozhio wyo de kpikpe Litafia wyo ma kpe Imani yea amma'de Yi u laafe haske Yie la'jin zanan ga ba yi na shiri mini wuzhi yi zhio. Akika ma Wyoe wu zazhi ba lo eko nantso yi gboro nan.
Surah 42:53       ,       The Way of Allah to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. Behold (how) all affairs tend towards Allah!,Eko yan Soko Etsu nan wun yan na fi sanmazhio to kin bo na akika ezhe keba yan alamari kpata eba Soko bo u dan'o.
