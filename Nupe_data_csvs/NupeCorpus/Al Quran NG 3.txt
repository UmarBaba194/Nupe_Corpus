I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall ye all return unto me and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute,Kamina Soko gan gan: Y`a wyoe Isa!

Surah 3:59 ,            The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him from dust then said to him: "Be". And he was,Akika kotonci yan Isa (kendoe Soko jin'u na)eba Soko  uyi ke kotonci yan (alitta) Adama na Soko jin alitu dagan jikanao gancin uci gan'u gan: "A fe"ucia fe acin.

Surah 3:62  ,            This is the true account: There is no god except Allah; and Allah-He is indeed the Exalted in Power the Wise,Akika nana gayi etan yan gaskiyao amade Tsoci ndondoa saide Soko. Akika ma Soko gayi Etsu zankpeo U ga mayi Etsu hikimao.

Surah 3:64,                              Say: "O People of the Book! come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but Allah; that we associate no partners with him; that we erect not from among ourselves Lords and patrons other than Allah." If then they turn back say ye: "Bear witness that we (at least) are Muslims (bowing to Allah´s Will), Gan gan: Ya ye za ba litafizhi!

Surah 3:66,                 Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing (Even) in matters of which ye had some knowledge! but why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge It is Allah Who knows and ye who know not!,Ye' dan-na ye gbomi dan mini yan na yetso kpe na to ki'ila ye cie gbomi dan mini yan na ye de ilimi wun'a na'yin'o Soko ma yi be kpikpe ye ma kpea.
Surah 3:67,             Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian; but he was true in Faith and bowed his will to Allah´s (Which is Islam) and he joined not gods with Allah,Ibrahimau fe Yahudia Uma fe Nasara' amma'ade wyun'afe eza nae ya pa gaskiyana na'a kpatsun ta ya foro Soko na uma fe dan mini za nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na boa.
Surah 3:68,            Without doubt among men the nearest of kin to Abraham are those who follow him as are also this Prophet and those who believe: And Allah is the Protector of those who have faith,Akika za nazhi gwoyin gan eba tsonbao be Ibrahimuy na agayi za nazhia emi tu'u nao to Annabi (Muhammad) na na to za nazhia imani jin na. Soko ga ma yi Ndakata yan Muminizhio.
Surah 3:69 ,           It is the wish of a section of the People of the Book to lead you astray. But they shall lead astray (Not you) but themselves and they do not perceive!, Jama'a ndocizhi mini zaba Litafizhio ajin guri na'aga ye gbin'na a ma'a gbin zandondo sai de eti'atso ammaa afe zanazhie wo sansan wuncin na'a.

Surah 3:72,               A section of the People of the Book say: "Believe in the morning what is revealed to the believers but reject it at the end of the day; perchance they may (themselves) Turn back,Jama'a ndocizhi mini zaba Litafizhio ci gan: Yea imani jin be yan na acin be ya zanazhia imani jin (be Muhammadui)na 'caba yan yigidiy yemae lae jin kafirinci beu yin zobau yin ujin wo be wuncin'y atsoa dazhin.
Surah 3:73 ,                             "And believe no one unless he follows your religion." Say: "True guidance is the Guidance of Allah: (Fear ye) Lest a revelation be sent to someone (else) Like unto that which was sent unto you or that those (Receiving such revelation) should engage you in argument before your Lord" Say: "All bounties are in the hand of Allah: He granteth them to whom He pleaseth: And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things.",Ye maega ya gaskiya ma be za na 'mi tu adini ye na. gan gan: Akika yan bawu ugayi bawu Soko.

Surah 3:75,                                   Among the People of the Book are some who if entrusted with a hoard of gold will (readily) pay it back; others who if entrusted with a single silver coin will not repay it unless thou constantly stoodest demanding because they say "there is no call on us (to keep faith) with these ignorant (Pagans)." but they tell a lie against Allah and (well) they know it.,Amade dan mini zaba Litafizhio za na wyo ga amana "kindari" (lisafi ewo) uyio na gbagba'a na) la'a yau'o laa yao na.

Surah 3:77,                          As for those who sell the faith they owe to Allah and their own plighted word for a small price they shall have no portion in the Hereafter: Nor will Allah (Deign to) speak to them or look at them on the Day of Judgment nor will He cleans them (of sin): They shall have a grievous penalty.Akika za nazhi-eda shi eyan tetengi izhe be alkawali Sokoe na gan-gani be kutizhia zhi -na zawuncinzhi ade robo ndondo ya'a ekuboa Soko ma'a gangan bea yin'a U ma' cin'ale (be eye yegun'y) efo Alkiyami yin'a uma'a li'a' Azaba na ma tan na ga ji tabbata ya'a.
Surah 3:78,                           There is among them a section who distort the Book with their tongues: (As they read) you would think it is a part of the Book but it is no part of the Book; and they say "That is from Allah" but it is not from Allah: It is they who tell a lie against Allah and (well) they know it,Akika amade jama'a ndocizhi dan miniabo ajin afe zhe gintara gba dan bayani Litafio ebo de ye'fe kpaye ke de (bayani yan etun yangban wuncin)dagan Litafi ga bo u fe beo na alali ma ujin dagan Litafi ga boa.

Surah 3:79 ,                          It is not (possible) that a man to whom is given the Book and Wisdom and the prophetic office should say to people: "Be ye my worshippers rather than Allah´s": on the contrary (He would say) "Be ye worshippers of Him Who is truly the Cherisher of all: For ye have taught the Book and ye have studied it earnestly.",Ugwo-yin ya zawangia ebo na Soko'a litafi to hukunci to Annabci la'a yau na gancin uciu feu gan'u ya zawangizhi gan: "Yeazhe wuzhizhi ya mi ke Soko lugwa'a Amma na gwoyin wyun'a gan nagayi yea fe eza bawta Soko zhi be iri ilimi nazhi ye de fi litafio na to kaatun nazhi ye'jin na.
Surah 3:80,            Nor would he instruct you to take angels and prophets for Lords and patrons. What! would he bid you to unbelief after ye have bowed your will (To Allah in Islam),Uma jin ye umurni gan ye dae la malaikazhi to Annabizhi ela Tsoci zhia. Kashi wyun'a jin ye umurni jin gan ye'laejin kafirinci baci na ye yeazhe musulumizhia ni na.
Surah 3:81,                                Behold! Allah took the covenant of the prophets saying: "I give you a Book and Wisdom; then comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you; do ye believe in him and render him help." Allah said: "Do ye agree and take this my Covenant as binding on you" They said: "We agree." He said: "Then bear witness and I am with you among the witnesses."(Wyo mao pa) Kamina Soko la alkawali be Annabizhi na (uci gan:) Mima litafi la'ayaye be hikimae gancin Tuci ci be yaye wyun'e ya gaskiya be yan na dan be ye yin na.

Surah 3:82,      If any turn back after this they are perverted transgressors,Zana zhi-ma ga zuma zheta baci wuncin'o na za wuncinzhi ga yi fasikizhio.
Surah 3:83,             Do they seek for other than the Religion of Allah-while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have willing or unwilling bowed to His Will (Accepted Islam) and to Him shall they all be brought back,Kashi adini ndoci ke yan Soko lugwa gae wa zao Alali ma zandondo na fi samazhio to kinbo na Soko gaata kpatsun yao eti banbao to eti kpakao E ba U gabo ma aku zawangizhi zheban lo'.
Surah 3:84,                            Say: "We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham Isma´il Isaac Jacob and the Tribes and in (the Books) given to Moses Jesus and the prophets from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them and to Allah do we bow our will (in Islam).",Gan gan: Yi yia imani jin be Sokoe be yan na a cin be ya yina be yana acin be ya Ibrahimae na to Ismaila to Ishaqa to Yakuba to Yagizhi na.

Surah 3:85,            If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah) never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good),Zandondo na ma gada wa ndoci yan Musulunci cigan adini na to a gwo gwa'uboa za wuncin ma ga'afe Efo Alkiyamio dan mini zanazhia jin asara nao.
Surah 3:86,                 How shall Allah Guide those who reject Faith after they accepted it and bore witness that the Messenger was true and that Clear Signs had come unto them but Allah guides not a people unjust,Ke wun'a zhe zhe na Soko ga bawu la'aya jama'a nazhi ajin kafirinci be sokoe baci na a imani jin be Sokoe nao. A tso ma eri jin ke Tuci (Soko) gaskiya uyio nao hujjazhi ma da be ya'a. Soko mae la jam'a yan Azwalumizhi kr ekoa.
Surah 3:87,        Of such the reward is that on them (rests) the curse of Allah of His angels and of all mankind,Zawuncinzhi egagba'a ugayi akika la'ana yan Soko ta etiabo to yan Malaikazhi to yan zawangizhi bae nio.
Surah 3:88,        In that will they dwell; nor will their penalty be lightened nor respite be (their lot);,Ama'fi bo fi tutun yin a'jin sauki azaba ya'a a ma pata ya'a.
Surah 3:89,          Except for those that repent (Even) after that and make amends; for verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Sai de za na zhi ga tuba jin zuma wuncin'o na acia gyara jin na to akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.

Surah 3:90 ,            But those who reject Faith after they accepted it and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith- never will their repentance be accepted; for they are those who have (of set purpose) gone astray,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci baci yan imania bo na gancin acie be be eti kafirincio na a'gwo tuba'a za wuncinzhima aga yi eza egbinzhio.
Surah 3:91,                       As to those who reject Faith and die rejecting- never would be accepted from any such as much gold as the earth contains though they should offer it for ransom. For such is (in store) a penalty grievous and they will find no helpers,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci na har acia tsu alalima kafirizhi ayio na a'gwo ewo zinari naashe izhe na dagan egwa zaeni ndondo miniabo ka aga ga ewo wuncin la'asa etia a'gwo egwa'a boa.

 Surah 3:97  ,                      In it are Signs Manifest; (for example) the Station of Abraham; whoever enters it attains security; Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to Allah- those who can afford the journey; but if any deny faith Allah stands not in need of any of His creatures,Mini ubo ayazhi danbo nazhia tula na (ke) kinigiba yan Ibrahima na.

Surah 3:99 ,                 Say: "O ye People of the Book! Why obstruct ye those who believe from the path of Allah Seeking to make it crooked while ye were yourselves witnesses (to Allah´s Covenant) but Allah is not unmindful of all that ye do.",Gan gan : "Ya ye zaba litafizhi!

Surah 3:103 ,                               And hold fast all together by the rope which Allah (stretches out for you) and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude Allah´s favour on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love so that by His Grace ye became brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire and He saved you from it. Thus doth Allah make His Signs clear to you: That ye may be guided,Ye mae la 'gwae sun egban yan Soko gbanyin baenio yemae ga kpe kpere kpere' ma.

Surah 3:105,             Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall into disputations after receiving Clear Signs: For them is a dreadful penalty,Ye mae ga'a fe ke zanazhia kpe kpere kpere'na ma baci na bayanizhi da be ya'a ni na. za wuncinzhi ma azaba na wancin na wun'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 3:106 ,               On the Day when some faces will be (lit up with) white and some faces will be (in the gloom of) black: To those whose faces will be black (will be said): "Did ye reject Faith after accepting it Taste then the penalty for rejecting Faith.",E fo'na fuska zandocizhi gaafu bokun be haske na fuska yan zandocizhi maga'shi zhiko za nazhi-ma fuska'azhi gaashi zhiko na (a gbin'agan gan:) Beke ye yea jin kafirinci jin baci yan imani yebo na Ebo acin'o e fe fin azaba ebo yannazhi ye'jin yan kafirinci na.

Surah 3:110  ,                    Ye are the best of peoples evolved for mankind enjoining what is right forbidding what is wrong and believing in Allah. If only the People of the Book had faith it were best for them: among them are some who have faith but most of them are perverted transgressors,Ye yea fe al'umma na de alheri gan na ala tinya ya zawangizhina ye'jin zazhi umurni be luilo etun wangi' ye mae kan etun na gyea na ye mae jin imani be Sokoe.

Surah 3:112 ,                                 Shame is pitched over them (Like a tent) wherever they are found except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah and from men; they draw on themselves wrath from Allah and pitched over them is (the tent of) destitution. This because they rejected the Signs of Allah and slew the prophets in defiance of right; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds,A egba be zunye sun'y wu kpea etio bandondo na aga tsoa gwa na sai de be alkawali na gboka na dagan eba Soko be alkawali dagan eba zawangizhio. Ama zheban be 'wunzhe dagan eba Soko acia ya ji wu ba'a etio. Wuncin ma yi akika ebo na afe zanazhie jin kafirinci be aya Soko zhi'ina ama fe'wu Annabi (Soko) zhi umayi be haki ndondo yin'a. Wuncin mayi ebo Soko naa le ba na ama'afe za nazhi e gbin iyaka tu na.
Surah 3:113,             Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of Allah all night long and they prostrate themselves in adoration,Ajin ye'nia dagan mini zaba litafizhioade jama'a nazhia kugikini wangi-na e'gba aya Soko zhi dan mini lokaci yan yeshio ama fe za nazhie dokun be sujada jin'y na.
Surah 3:114 ,             They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous,E'la imani jin be Sokoe to be Efo zobae a mae jin zazhi foro be etun wangizhiamae kangwa yan etun dedezhiamae dinye dan luilo yan etun alherizhio. Zawuncinzhi ma a fe dan mini za guruzhio.
Surah 3:115,        Of the good that they do nothing will be rejected of them; for Allah knoweth well those that do right,Etun ndondo na ma aga lo yan alheri na a la egagba'u a kan'a'a Soko ma yi be kpikpe yan za nazhie sundan soko na.
Surah 3:116,                 Those who reject Faith- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah: They will be companions of the Fire-dwelling therein (for ever),Akika za nzhia jin kafirinci na dukiya'azhi to egiazhi a kunke ya'a wo be yandondoe dagan eba Sokooa. Zawuncinzhi ma a gayi egi mi'na zhio.
Surah 3:117 ,                     What they spend in the life of this (material) world May be likened to a wind which brings a nipping frost: It strikes and destroys the harvest of men who have wronged their own souls: it is not Allah that hath wronged them but they wrong themselves,Kotonci yan dukiya nae wu dan mini edunfe izhe nanao na u yi ke kotonci efe na yeko fu dan nin yan'ubo na uci da tswan yandzo yan jama'a ndoci nazhia etitancin'a jin zwalunci na uci'ujin hallaka Soko ma jin'a zwaluncia amma'ade eti tacin'a tso gae jin zwaluncio.
Surah 3:118 ,                            O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks: They will not fail to corrupt you. They only desire your ruin: Rank hatred has already appeared from their mouths: What their hearts conceal is far worse. We have made plain to you the Signs if ye have wisdom.Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega da da eya yan asiri be zandocizhi na jin zaba imania na ma a cinta ya ye be egun jin yin'a.

Surah 3:119 ,                         Ah! ye are those who love them but they love you not- though ye believe in the whole of the Book. When they meet you they say "We believe": But when they are alone they bite off the very tips of their fingers at you in their rage. Say: "Perish in you rage; Allah knoweth well all the secrets of the heart.",Ye'ga dan nao Ye ye' wa'a a mae wa ye yea. Ye ma gan yea imani jin be litafiy bae nio.

Surah 3:120 ,                   If aught that is good befalls you it grieves them; but if some misfortune overtakes you they rejoice at it. But if ye are constant and do right not the least harm will their cunning do to you; for Allah Compasseth round about all that they do,Kamina alheri ndoci ga'ade ye na wun'ela yangban'azhia yin egun ndoci ma ga'a tswanye ajin afe fa yangban be wunci'y. Ye ma ga guri jin ye cie sundan Soko tanadi ndondoa la egun tswan ye yea. Akika Soko a makezhe be iri etun nazhi e'lo na. 
Surah 3:121,          Remember that morning Thou didst leave Thy household (early) to post the faithful at their stations for battle: And Allah heareth and knoweth all things,(Wyo mao pa) Na wyo saka tinya dagan eba iyali wyozhio na wyo cie la Muminizhi shishi dan dannazhio ebo ekun'o na Soko ma Etsu nae wo yandondo na uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio. 
Surah 3:122,           Remember two of your parties Meditated cowardice; but Allah was their protector and in Allah should the faithful (Ever) put their trust,(Wyo mao pa ) Kamina jama'a yan ena guba mini ye bo akpa gan a ga to gbogun na (aga zuma ya ) Soko ga mayi Ndakata zaguba'abao ebo acin'o Muminizhi de a la'a kpea tswo soko. 
Surah 3:123 ,        Allah had helped you at Badr when ye were a contemptible little force; then fear Allah; thus May ye show your gratitude.,Akika ma Soko jin ye taimako dan ekun yan Badaruo kanga a ye yi gbogun ebo acin'o e sundan Soko ujin wo be wuncin'y ye ga'fe za nazhie jin ye bo ya Soko na. 
Surah 3:124 ,           Remember thou saidst to the Faithful: "Is it not enough for you that Allah should help you with three thousand angels (Specially) sent downKamina wyo fe gan gan be Muminizhi na Asha U kunye kea na Tsoci ye ajin ye taimako be malaikazhi kputsun'utsun eda guta nazhia fe cinbe dagan samao naa 
Surah 3:125,              "Yea - if ye remain firm and act aright even if the enemy should rush here on you in hot haste your Lord would help you with five thousand angels Making a terrific onslaught,Acinga gao akika ye ga akuri jin ye cie sundan Soko kada makirizhi ga be dzun fi ye be girikuy iri nanae Tsoci ye ajin'e taimako be malaika kpautsun'tsun har eda gutsun zhi nazhi ma'ayi be alamazhi na. 
Surah 3:126  ,              Allah made it but a message of hope for you and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from Allah. The Exalted the Wise,Soko ma la wuncin la'afea sai de ebo ula'uzhe bushara'u yaye ebo ma yangban yezhia la'ashi beuyin. Taimako ma wun'e fea sai de dagan eba Soko Etsu na yi Etsu zankpe na Umayi Etsu hikima na.
 Surah 3:127,        That He might cut off a fringe of the Unbelievers or expose them to infamy and they should then be turned back frustrated of their purpose.Ebo wyun'ula kansan ndoci yan kafirizhi'u zun koma wyun'u la'au sunzunye har atsoa la'a zheban ala'afe eza zunzunyacizhi. 
Surah 3:128,           Not for thee (but for Allah) is the decision: Whether He turn in mercy to them or punish them; for they are indeed wrong-doers,Wyode kagbo ndondo etiaboa (sai de wyo wu yan ) ko wun'aba Soko ugwo tuba na'jin na wyun'a ba Uma ujin'a azaba. Akika azwalumizhi ayio. 
Surah 3:129 ,             To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and punisheth whom He pleaseth; but Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Soko ga ma wun yannafi samazhio nao to nazhi fi kinbo nao wyun'e fa be za na ga bau na U mae jin za na ga bau na azaba Soko ma Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio. 
Surah 3:130 ,          O ye who believe! Devour not usury doubled and multiplied; but fear Allah; that ye may (really) prosper,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega gi riba ekpeba dozhi ta eti ekpeba dozhio maye mae sundan Soko ujin wo be wuncin'y ye ga 'atswo gurizhi. 
Surah 3:131 ,   Fear the Fire which is repaired for those who reject Faith,Ye mae tswa ena na Soko jin shiri ya kafirizhi na.
 Surah 3:132,    And obey Allah and the Messenger; that ye may obtain mercy,Ye mae la 'mie tu Soko be Tuci (Sokoe) ujinwo be wuncin'y a gun'e ye 
Surah 3:132,    And obey Allah and the Messenger; that ye may obtain mercy,Ye mae la 'mie tu Soko be Tuci (Sokoe) ujinwo be wuncin'y a gun'e ye 
Surah 3:133 ,         Be quick in the race for forgiveness from your Lord and for a Garden whose width is that (of the whole) of the heavens and of the earth prepared for the righteous,Ye mae dinye' dan wiwa yan gafarao dagan eba Tsoci yebo to Aljanna na epe'u yi ke samazhi be kin yin na.Ama jin shiri'ujin ya zana nazhie gae sundan Sokona. 
Surah 3:134,            Those who spend (freely) whether in prosperity or in adversity; who restrain anger and pardon (all) men;- for Allah loves those who do good;-Za nazhie wu dukiya'azhi (fi eko wangio) dan lokaci yan bagwo'ona to lokaci ba pin'yna to za nazhie jin guri acie la fushiazhi nyin na to za nazhie fa be le'fi zazhi-na Soko mae wa za nazhie jin bolobolo na. 
Surah 3:135 ,                    And those who having done something to be ashamed of or wronged their own souls earnestly bring Allah to mind and ask for forgiveness for their sins- and who can forgive sins except Allah- and are never obstinate in persisting knowingly in (the wrong) they have done,To za nazhi Kamina aga etun alfasha lo na ko ma acia eti tacin'a jin zwalunci na ajin apa Soko na gancin acie ba gafara yan zunubiazhi na. Zai ma danbo nae fa be zunubizhi-nao sai de Soko. Amae tu gikini ta eti etun le'fiazhi boa alali ma atso kpe wo gan ugye'a na'a. 
Surah 3:136 ,             For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath- an eternal dwelling: How excellent a recompense for those who work (and strive),Zawuncinzhi kpata egagba'a yi gafara dagan eba Tsociabo gan ni be emi Aljannazhi-nazhi nuwan eduzhie je fi tako''abo na. Baga bo ma'afi tutun yin'o. Madanla be egagba yan zanazhie lo 'tun wagi na. 
Surah 3:136,              For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath- an eternal dwelling: How excellent a recompense for those who work (and strive)!,Zawuncinzhi kpata egagba'a yi gafara dagan eba Tsociabo gan ni be emi Aljannazhi-nazhi nuwan eduzhie je fi tako''abo na. Baga bo ma'afi tutun yin'o. Madanla be egagba yan zanazhie lo 'tun wagi na.
 Surah 3:137 ,           Many were the Ways of Life that have passed away before you: travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth,Misali yan ekpa wangi wangizhi a shi ye dzo'ani ebo acin'o yetsoe dazn'efi mini kinbo gancin yecie cin'ele'lo iri kendoe zoba ganmana zuncizhizyi na.
 Surah 3:138,     Here is a plain statement to men a guidance and instruction to those who fear Allah!Nana bayani uyio ya zawangizhi u mayi bawu to wa'azi ya zanazhie sundan Soko na. 
Surah 3:139 ,      So lose not heart nor fall into despair: For ye must gain mastery if ye are true in Faith,Ye mae ga to gbogun ma Ye mae ga nyin yangban ma yegazhi yi za nazhi latu gan nao matuka ye de ga'afe Muminizhi na. 
Surah 3:140 ,                      If a wound hath touched you be sure a similar wound hath touched the others. Such days (of varying fortunes) We give to men and men by turns: that Allah may know those that believe and that He may take to Himself from your ranks Martyr-witnesses (to Truth). And Allah loveth not those that do wrong,E-ba-yin ndoci ga'ade ye eba yin iri wuncin de zandocizhi leani efo wuncizhi ma yi yiajin yi fe' san'ugwasan dan tsakani zawangizhio ebo soko udeba'u la kpikpe'u wu yan zanazhi ga jin imani (yan gaskiya na) Uma'ude za nazhiatsu tsutsu yan erizhi na dagan mini yebo. Soko mae wa azwalumizhia. 
Surah 3:141,    Allah´s object also is to purge those that are true in Faith and to deprive of blessing Those that resist Faith.Ebo ma ude ba'u la sinsan-wangi ula'udan za nazhia imani jin na (ke aibi kpata lugwa ) U ma'u la albarka'u wa'uya nakan kafirizhio. 
Surah 3:142 ,           Did ye think that ye would enter Heaven without Allah testing those of you who fought hard (In His Cause) and remained steadfast,Kashi ye' kpaye kpa gan ye ga de gandan Aljannao alali ma Soko la'la zanazhie ceko ya Soko mini yebo na wua Uma la'ala za nazhie jin hakuri na wu (be mima cinle yin'a). 
Surah 3:143,           Ye did indeed wish for death before ye met him: Now ye have seen him with your own eyes (And ye flinch!),Akika ma ye yea fe shidzo batso zhio ye fe jin guri yan ajali tun u la be de ye yea akika gbani ye yeu le yeani gancin yecei cin ba le. 
Surah 3:144,                          Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many Were the messenger that passed away before him. If he died or were slain will ye then Turn back on your heels If any did turn back on his heels not the least harm will he do to Allah; but Allah (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude.
Surah 3:145 ,                      Nor can a soul die except by Allah´s leave the term being fixed as by writing. If any do desire a reward in this life We shall give it to him; and if any do desire a reward in the Hereafter We shall give it to him. And swiftly shall We reward those that (serve us with) gratitude,Uma'a ye jin na rayi ndondo a tsu na'a sai de be izini Sokoe alkawali uyio na;adan kangi be ajali-na. Zandondo na ma gae kpa laada izhe (be etun'yn na) Yia la yau dagan miniubo zandondo na ma gae kpa laada yan Alkiyami na Yia la yau dagan miniubo. Bele'yin ma. Yia la egagba wangi ya zanazhi gae jin yeabo ya Soko na. 
Surah 3:146,                    How many of the prophets fought (in Allah´s way) and with them (fought) Large bands of godly men but they never lost heart if they met with disaster in Allah´s way nor did they weaken (in will) nor give in. And Allah Loves those who are firm and steadfast,Dokun dokun mini yan Annabizhio a gunkun dan eko Soko amayi be eza Soko zhi na dokun na nazhi pama bea yin na yangban'azhi ma nakin be iiri yannazhi tswan'a eti ekpa Soko na'a ama to gbogun'a ama ya tia. Soko mae de cincin yan za nazhie jin hakuri na.
 Surah 3:147,                  All that they said was: "Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and anything We may have done that transgressed our duty: Establish our feet firmly and help us against those that resist Faith.",E gan'a ma ufe'a sai de egan na'agan gan: "Tsoci yan yi! Fa be zunubi yizhiy to barna (eyan nyin) nazhi yi yin dan mini alamari yi zhio na wyo mao la bici kinpa yizhio kpe kin wangiy. Wyo mao jin yi taimako ta eti jama'a yan kafirizhio". 
Surah 3:148 ,        And Allah gave them a reward in this world and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For Allah Loveth those who do good,Soko ci ga'a gba laada yan izhe' ganni be bolobolo yan laada alkiyamiy. Soko mae wa za nazhi gae jin bolobolo na. 
Surah 3:149 ,          O ye who believe! If ye obey the Unbelievers they will drive you back on your heels and ye will turn back (from Faith) to your own loss.Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! yega 'mi tu za nazhi jin kafirinci na a ga ye la'a zheban da dandan yezhi gancin yeci ga'afe eza hasarazhi. 
Surah 3:150 ,    Nay Allah is your protector and He is the best of helpers,A'a Soko tsayi Ndakata yeyeo wyun ga ma dokun gan eba jinjin taimako bo. 
Surah 3:151,                  Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers for that they joined companions with Allah for which He had sent no authority: their abode will be the Fire: And evil is the home of the wrong-doers,Yi ga edo cedan yangban yan kafirizhio ebo eyan nazhie la pa Soko baci nao nama Soko cin hujja ndondo be tia boa na. Ezhe keba'a mayi ena. Bibi majin tabbata ya ecinba yan azwalumizhi. 
Surah 3:152 ,                                      Allah did indeed fulfil His promise to you when ye with His permission Were about to annihilate your enemy-until ye flinched and fell to disputing about the order and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight (of the booty) which ye covet. Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you but He forgave you: For Allah is full of grace to those who believe,Sokoa alkawali'U be ye yin she yaye be gaskiyae lokaci na ye fe'wu makiri yezhi be izini Sokoe na har da kamina ye bea gbakpan na yecife' gbo 'mi be dozhi eti umurni na'ala ya ye nao yecia le ba baci na Sokoa yan na ye' wa na la'awu ye na.

Soko ma Etsu falala uyio ya Muminizhi.
 Surah 3:153 ,                       Behold! ye were climbing up the high ground without even casting a side glance at any one and the Messenger in your rear was calling you back. There did Allah give you one distress after another by way of requital to teach you not to grieve for (the booty) that had escaped you and for (the ill) that had befallen you. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do,Kamina ye fe' gunta eti patio na yema zhe ka kansan cin zandondo lea alali ma Tuci Soko dan batsozhio cie ta 'mi yiye. Soko ci gae-gba be yangban- yin'y ta eti yangban yin'o ebo ye ga nyin yangban eti yan na'a fan ye gwa na mao. Ye mae ga nyin yangban eti yanna tswan ye na mao. Soko mayi be kpikpe yan etun nazhi ye' lo na. 
Surah 3:154       ,                                                                   After (the excitement) of the distress He sent down calm on a band of you overcome with slumber while another band was stirred to anxiety by their own feelings Moved by wrong suspicions of Allah-suspicions due to ignorance. They said: "What affair is this of ours" Say thou: "Indeed this affair is wholly Allah´s." They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee. They say (to themselves): "If we had had anything to do with this affair We should not have been in the slaughter here." Say: "Even if you had remained in your homes those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death"; but (all this was) that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts,Gancin Soko ci cin aminci bea yaye baci yangban nyin'o ugayi igbe tao na'a rukpe kansan ndoci ma miniabo shagala yan eti tacin'a wun'ajin shagala acie kpaye natso jin yan gaskiya'a na lo eba Soko iri yekpa yan (jahiliyazhi) eza rakpezhi.

Surah 3:155 ,                   Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts Met-it was Satan who caused them to fail because of some (evil) they had done. But Allah Has blotted out (their fault): For Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Forbearing.Akika za nazhi zhe zumata fo na jama'a gubaba keba na akika shetan tsa dan'akin yin'o ebo sashi woce dede (yan le'fi Soko) nae ce nao. Akika ma Soko fa bea yin. Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu hakuri uyio.
 Surah 3:156,                                   O ye who believe! Be not like the Unbelievers who say of their brethren when they are travelling through the Earth or engaged in fighting: "If they had stayed with us they would not have died or been slain." This that Allah may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is Allah that gives Life and Death and Allah sees well all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ye ga'afe ke za nazhia jin kafirici na ma nazhie gan ya yegiazhi kamina aga tinya dan ezan'o kinbo na ko ma aga dan eba ekun'o na: "Da'aci gan be yi yin adan'o da'a tsua a ma'a wu'a Nana ma (uyi) ebo Sokoula egan na'agan shidzo na ulaufe robonkpe'u ya'a fi mini yangban azhio. Soko gamae dan yan rayio wyun ga mae wu rayio. Soko mae cinye le be iri etun nazhi ye'lo nae. 
Surah 3:157  ,           And if ye are slain or die in the way of Allah forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than all they could amass.Akika ma ka aga ye wu dan eko Soko ko ma yecia tsu akika gafara dagan nko yan Soko be yegun'y ade alheri gan yan na zawangizhie kuyekan (izheo na). 
Surah 3:158      And if ye die or are slain Lo! it is unto Allah that ye are brought together.Kama yega'tsu ko ma acia ye wu akika eba Soko gabo'aku ye yekan zhio. 
Surah 3:159,                             It is part of the Mercy of Allah that thou dost deal gently with them Wert thou severe or harsh-hearted they would have broken away from about thee: so pass over (Their faults) and ask for (Allah´s) forgiveness for them; and consult them in affairs (of moment). Then when thou hast Taken a decision put thy trust in Allah. For Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him).Ebo yegun ndoci dagan eba Soko wyoe da cici ya' da wyo ga'fe za nae zhewun uma gboka yangban na da aga'ga- yan'aya dagan eba wyo bo.

Surah 3:160 ,                If Allah helps you none can overcome you: If He forsakes you who is there after that that can help you in Allah then Let believers put their trust.Soko ga ye jin taimako'ani zandondo danbo na'a zan yekpe be na'a  Uma ga'a dzungan'e bo to zi danbo na'ajin ye taimako zuma'Ubo nao Soko tsama Muminizhi yakpeo'.
 Surah 3:160,                 If Allah helps you none can overcome you: If He forsakes you who is there after that that can help you in Allah then Let believers put their trust.Soko ga ye jin taimako'ani zandondo danbo na'a zan yekpe be na'a  Uma ga'a dzungan'e bo to zi danbo na'ajin ye taimako zuma'Ubo nao Soko tsama Muminizhi yakpeo'.

 Surah 3:161,                    No prophet could (ever) be false to his trust. If any person is so false He shall on the Day of Judgment restore what he misappropriated; then shall every soul receive its due- whatever it earned- and none shall be dealt with unjustly,Uma'a gwoyin na Annabi ndondo a yi eyan jama'azhi na'a.

 Surah 3:162 ,           Is the man who follows the good pleasure of Allah Like the man who draws on himself the wrath of Allah and whose abode is in Hell- A woeful refuge!,Ngba za na emitu (etun) yan yedajin Soko na ugazhe ye'ni be za nae dingwa da wa ewunzhe yan Soko na ezhe kebau cia zhe jahannama na Bibi ma ajin tabbata ya ezhe keba wuncin. 
Surah 3:163,       They are in varying gardens in the sight of Allah and Allah sees well all that they do.A (wuncizhi) darajazhi ayio eba yan Soko bo. Soko mae cin'ale be iri etu nazhie lo na. 
Surah 3:164 ,                       Allah did confer a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a messenger from among themselves rehearsing unto them the Signs of Allah sanctifying them and instructing them in Scripture and Wisdom while before that they had been in manifest error,Akika Sokoa eryatwa wanciko la'aya Muminizhi ebo Tuci nau tun-tun fia daga miniatso' na ucie gba ayauzhi ya'a umae taadzu umae la ilimi yan litafi to hikimazhi wua. Ama'afe shidzo batsozhio dan mini egbin na'tula nao. 
Surah 3:165 ,                  What! When a single disaster smites you although ye smote (your enemies) with one twice as great do ye say- "Whence is this" Say (to them): "It is from yourselves: For Allah hath power over all things,"Kashi kamina ma mimacinle ndoci gaa tswan'ye na alali ma yetso la iri wuncin (guba) tswan zazhi lean-ye fe gan gan: Dagan babo nna fe beo Gan gan: "Dagan eba yetso bo ufe beo" Akika ma Soko de kagbo ta eti yandondo'. 
Surah 3:166,        What ye suffered on the day the two armies Met was with the leave of Allah in order that He might test the believers,Yan na na ma tswan ye fo na jama'a guba'ba keba na to be izini yan Soko yin'o. Ebo ma Soko ude ba'u la mumini yan gaskiyazhi'u tu (ebo'a kpea ye). 
Surah 3:167 ,                               And the Hypocrites also. These were told: "Come fight in the way of Allah or (at least) drive (The foe from your city)." They said: "Had we known how to fight we should certainly have followed you." They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal,Ebo ma' Ula munafikizhi'a tua la (ezazhia kpea'ye) ama ci gan'a gan: Edabe ye be gukun'edan eko Soko' ko ma ye'la makirizhie nyan'e tin'eya. Aci gan: Yi ga kpe kpe ke ekun'a danbo na da yi ga 'mitu ye" fo wuncin a tsoba kafirinci fia gan imani. Acie gan gan be misun'azhi yan na ujin'a acin uyi dan yangban'azhi boa na.

Surah 3:168,              (They are) the ones that say (of their brethren slain) while they themselves sit (at ease): "If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain." Say: "Avert death from your own selves if ye speak the truth.",Za nazhi- gan ya yegiazhi atso ma'afe dun na "Da aci gan a mi tu yi tu daa a wu'a Gan gan: Yetsoe la tsutsue dagwae ya'e eti tacin ye' yi wun'ayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na. 
Surah 3:168 ,             (They are) the ones that say (of their brethren slain) while they themselves sit (at ease): "If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain." Say: "Avert death from your own selves if ye speak the truth.",Za nazhi- gan ya yegiazhi atso ma'afe dun na "Da aci gan a mi tu yi tu daa a wu'a Gan gan: Yetsoe la tsutsue dagwae ya'e eti tacin ye' yi wun'ayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na. Surah 3:169            Think not of those who are slain in Allah´s way as dead. Nay they live finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord;Wyo mao ga kpaye gan za nazhiaga wu fi eko Soko'na a tsu ma. A'a ayi be rayia yin dan nko Tsocia bo e'ya'a arzikizhi gi. 
Surah 3:170,                  They rejoice in the bounty provided by Allah: And with regard to those left behind who have not yet joined them (in their bliss) the (Martyrs) glory in the fact that on them is no fear nor have they (cause to) grieve,Acie fa yangban be yan nazhi soko la ya'a mini eryatwa u zhio na a mae la bushara ya za nazhi la'abe tsun'a ya'a na mini nazhi dan zuma'abo na. Ke de' eyan dansun ndondo dan bo ya a ama'ale yangban yin ndondo yea.
 Surah 3:171,          They glory in the Grace and the bounty from Allah and in the fact that Allah suffereth not the reward of the Faithful to be lost (in the least),E'fa yangban be ni'imae dagan eba Soko' ganni be eryatwa uyin. Akika ma Sokoe ta la'ada yan etun Muminizhi yakpea. 
Surah 3:172  ,            Of those who answered the call of Allah and the Messenger even after being wounded those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward,Za nazhi ye yiyi yan Soko to Tuci'I na baci yan etin nazhi dea na. Egagba wanciko ma'ajin tabbata ya za nazhi gae jin bolobolo acie sundan Soko na. 
Surah 3:173,                Men said to them: "A great army is gathering against you": And frightened them: But it (only) increased their Faith: They said: "For us Allah sufficeth and He is the best disposer of affairs.",Za nazhi zawangizhi gan ya'a gan: Akika zawangizhia gun eti yebo ebo acin'o e sundan'a. wuncin na'agan na ci bea imani aci gan: Sokoa kunke ya yiyio madanla be Ndakatabo yan Sokoe. 
Surah 3:174,              And they returned with Grace and bounty from Allah: no harm ever touched them: For they followed the good pleasure of Allah: And Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded,Aci zheban da'a da be ni'imae dagan eba Soko ganni be eryatwae egun ndondo ma la'gwa toa acia emitu yan na Soko jin yeda beyin na. Soko ma Etsu ryatwa uyio na wancin na. 
Surah 3:175,          It is only the Evil One that suggests to you the fear of his votaries: Be ye not afraid of them but fear Me if ye have Faith,Akika wuncin de (egan) shetan tsa uyio na wyun'e la'ali masoyiuzhi dan na Ebo acin'o ega sundan'a ma esundan Mi wun'ayi Muminizhi ga ye yio na. 
Surah 3:176,                     Let not those grieve thee who rush headlong into Unbelief: Not the least harm will they do to Allah: Allah´s plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter but a severe punishment,Za nazhi-ma e'da din yin dan etun kafirincio na ga lugwa wuncin nyin wyoe yangban ma. Akika ajin Soko gun wo be yandondo yin'a. Sokoe kpa kpa gan wyun'a la robo ndondo ya'a efo Alkiyamia. Azaba na ma tan na wun'ajin tabbata ya'a. 
Surah 3:177,           Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith- not the least harm will they do to Allah but they will have a grievous punishment.Akika zanazhi da shi kafirinci be imani-na ajin Soko 'gun be yandondoe woa azaba na ma tan na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a. 
Surah 3:177 ,          Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith- not the least harm will they do to Allah but they will have a grievous punishment,Akika zanazhi da shi kafirinci be imani-na ajin Soko 'gun be yandondoe woa azaba na ma tan na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a. 
Surah 3:178 ,              Let not the Unbelievers think that our respite to them is good for themselves: We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity: But they will have a shameful punishment,Za nazhi- ma'ajin kafirici na a ga kpa ye kpa gan eta pa na yie la ya'a na alheri uyio ya rayiao ma. Akika Yie pata pa ya'a ebo ade ba'ade bibe yan le'fi jin azaba yan egba ma ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.
 Surah 3:179,                                   Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now until He separates what is evil from what is good nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen. But He chooses of His Messengers (For the purpose) whom He pleases. So believe in Allah. And His messengers: And if ye believe and do right ye have a reward without measure,U fe acin ya Sokoa na'Uga Muminizhi ya ta eti yanna ye kpe tiubo naa sai de uga erikpe la'adan tsakani eyan dedezhi kperi be eyan wangizhi. Uma feacin ya Soko na uga gaibu la'awuye na'a. Amaade Soko ajin'utsa dagan mini Tuci'uzhio zana ga ba una. Ebo acin'o yea imani jin be Sokoe be Tuciuzhi.

Surah 3:180    ,                         And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which Allah Hath given them of His Grace think that it is good for them: Nay it will be the worse for them: soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied to their necks Like a twisted collar on the Day of Judgment. To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Za nazhi mae tan yanbo be yan na Soko la ya'a dagan mini falala ubo na a ga kpa ye gan alheri wun'ayi ya'ao ma. A'a sharri wun'ayi ya'ao. A ma ga'la'a gwo'a(koro) Efo Alkiyamiy Soko gama wun egun yan samazhi to kin yin'o. Soko mayi be kpikpe yan etun nazhi ye'lo na.

 Surah 3:181 ,                    Allah hath heard the taunt of those who say: "Truly Allah is indigent and we are rich!"- We shall certainly record their word and (their act) of slaying the prophets in defiance of right and We shall say: "Taste ye the penalty of the Scorching Fire!,Akika Soko wo egan za nazhi gangan: "Akika Soko talaka uyio Yi ma eyandecizhi yiyio na" Yi ga yan na'agan na ka to wuwu ma'awu Annabizhi umayi be haki ndondo yin'a na. Yi cia gan gan: "Efe fin azaba ena dindinci". 
Surah 3:182,        "This is because of the (unrighteous deeds) which your hands sent on before ye: For Allah never harms those who serve Him.",Wuncin mayi ebo etun dede na egwa yetsozhi lashidzo nao. Akika ma Soko jin azwalumi lo eba wuzhi ndondoa. 
Surah 3:183  ,                         They (also) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in an messenger unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: why then did ye slay them if ye speak the truth",Za nazhi gan gan: "Akika Soko jin alkawali be yi yin gan yi-ga jin imani be Tuci ndondoe ma sai U ga be be dabba zunzunci na ena'afe giu na". Gan gan: Akika Tuicizhi be ya ye shi-midzo ganni be yanna ye gan nae ki-la yecia wuao wun'ayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio nao. 
Surah 3:184  ,         Then if they reject thee so were rejected messengers before thee who came with Clear Signs Books of dark prophecies and the Book of Enlightenment,A maga (egan) wyoe yi ganmana akika a yi egan Tuci nazhi shi wyo dzo na ganmana acin ga a ma be be hujjazhi be litafizhiy ama be be litafi na'ashe be haske'na. 
Surah 3:185 ,                     Every soul shall have a taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have attained the object (of Life): For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception,Rayi ndondo sai uga egwa ladan ajali da'a 'mi. Akika ma aga laada etun yezhi she yaye Efo Alkiyamiy. Zandondo na aga'a la kpeya be enaena aciu la'a gandan Aljannao na akika zawuncin'ade robo yan egwagan emawo yan edunfe izhe ma ufea sai de kaya etazhi. 
Surah 3:186,                       Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and ye shall certainly Hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods. But if ye persevere patiently and guard against evil-then that will be a determining factor in all affairs,Akika a' mae cin le mini dukiyaezhio to rayiezhio akika ye m'a wo egan egunzhi dagan misun za nazhiala litafi ya shi ye dzo nao to eba za nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na egan egun na dokun na amma' ye ga hakuri jin yeci sundan Soko akika wuncin dan mini alamari nazhi wancin na. 
Surah 3:187,                    And remember Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book to make it known and clear to mankind and not to hide it; but they threw it away behind their backs and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made!,(Wyo mao pa) lokaci na Soko la alkawali be za nazhi a la litafi ya na kede akika yega'ujin bayani ya zawangizhi na ye mae ga swo'u ma Aci'u ceya ci zuma'abo aci da'a eyan tetengi izhe shi be'u yin. Bibi ma'jin tabbata ya yanna a shi na.
 Surah 3:188          ,         Think not that those who exult in what they have brought about and love to be praised for what they have not done- think escape the penalty. For them is a penalty Grievous indeed.,Wyo mao ga kpaye gan zanazhie fa yangban be yan na a la laya za na a mae wa gan a jin yebo' aya'a be etun na ujin a loa na. Ega kpaye gan aga gangwa be azabae ma. Azaba na ma tan na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.
 Surah 3:189,        To Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah hath power over all things,Mulki yan samazhi to yan kin Soko wun'o. Soko ma de kagbo ta eti yandondo.

Surah 3:190 ,         Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day- there are indeed Signs for men of understanding,Akika mini alitta jin yan samazhio to yan kin to egbazhe yan yeshi be batin'y aya zhi fi bo ya za nazhi gayi eza hankalizhina. 
Surah 3:191 ,                   Men who celebrate the praises of Allah standing sitting and lying down on their sides and contemplate the (wonders of) creation in the heavens and the earth (With the thought): "Our Lord! not for naught Hast Thou created (all) this! Glory to Thee! Give us salvation from the penalty of the Fire,Za nazhie pa Soko gi gbaro' to edunfe bao to kamina aga'yaci cia kansan ya kin na acie kpaye wangi dan jin jin yan samazhio to kin na.

Surah 3:198 ,                   On the other hand for those who fear their Lord are Gardens with rivers flowing beneath; therein are they to dwell (for ever)- a gift from the presence of Allah; and that which is in the presence of Allah is the best (bliss) for the righteous,Ammaade za nazhie sundan Tsocia na ayibe egagba yan Aljannazhiy nazhi nuwan zhie je fi takoabo na.

 Surah 3:199 ,                            And there are certainly among the People of the Book those who believe in Allah in the revelation to you and in the revelation to them bowing in humility to Allah: They will not sell the Signs of Allah for a miserable gain! For them is a reward with their Lord and Allah is swift in account,Akika ma ade dan mini zaba litafizhio za na'a imani jin be Sokoe na uma'ajin be yan na'acin be ya'atso na e'dakpaya ya Soko e'la aya Soko zhi shi eyan tetengi yan izhea.
