Surah 35:1 ,                       Praise be to Allah Who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth Who made the angels messengers with wings- two or three or four (pairs): He adds to Creation as He pleases: for Allah has power over all things.,Yebo kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu nan jin alitta sanmazhi to kin nan Etsu nan'a Malaikazhi fe Tucizhi nanzhiy yi be gwapazhiy nan. Ndoci'azhi de guba guba to guta-guta to guni-guni. U mae kezhe be yannan ga ba'u nan mini alita jin'o. Akika Soko Etsu nan de iko nan uyio ta eti yandondo.
Surah 35:2   ,               What Allah out of his Mercy doth bestow on mankind there is none can withhold: what He doth withhold there is none can grant apart from Him: and He is the Exalted in Power full of Wisdom.,Eko ndondo nan Soko ga kpeya zawangizhi mini yegun'u bo nan a de za nan kan'uwo naa na ma u gaakan nan zandondo la'u ya za wo baci'u boa. (Akika Soko) Etsu zankpe uyio Egba uyio.
Surah 35:3         ,           O men! Call to mind the grace of Allah unto you! is there a creator other than Allah to give you sustenance from heaven or earth There is no god but He: how then are ye deluded away from the Truth,Ya ye zawangizhi e fe pa ni'ima Soko nanzhiy ta eti yebo nan. Kashi ade halitta jinci ndoci baci Soko na eya ye arziki dagan sanmao to kinbo nan Akika a de yandoci nan'ajin bauta ya naa sai Soko. Kiy be la a cie la ye pan ya ke eko lugwao
Surah 35:4     ,     And if they reject thee so were messengers rejected before thee: to Allah back for decision all affairs.,A ma ga wyo yi ganmanan zunci Akika acinga agan be Tuci nanzhiy shi wyo dzo nan yin'o. Alamari kpata ma a kezhe daa eba Soko.
Surah 35:5    ,         O men! Certainly the promise of Allah is true. Let not then this present life deceive you nor let the Chief Deceiver deceive you about Allah.,Ya ye zawangizhi akika alkawali Soko gaskiya uyio ebo acin'o e ga lugwa edunfe izhe ta ye ma ye mae ga lugwa (shaitan) nan'e ta zazhi nan ta ye ma.
Surah 35:6     ,       Verily Satan is an enemy to you: so treat him as an enemy. He only invites his adherents that they may become Companions of the Blazing Fire.,Akika shaitan makiri ye uyio ebo acin'o ye tso'u la makiri. Akika wun'e yi jama'a yin'uzhi yi ebo a lazhe egimi nanzhi.
Surah 35:7  ,          For those who reject Allah is a terrible Penalty: but for those who believe and work righteous deeds is Forgiveness and a magnificent Reward.,Za nanzhia jin kafirinci nan azaba nan tan saruyin nan a jin tabbata ya'a za nanzhi ma'a'imani jin nan acie lotun wangizhi nan gafara to lada nan wancin nan ajin tabbata yaa
Surah 35:8        ,                Is he then to whom the evil of his conduct is made alluring so that he looks upon it as good (equal to one who is rightly guided) For Allah leaves to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So let not thy soul go out in (vainly) sighing after them: for Allah knows well all that they do!,Ngba za nan'a etun dede'u la'apa nin fiu nan wuntso cie le'u ye wangi nan (u gaa zhe nini be za gurui) Akika Soko egbin za nan ga bau nan u mae la za nan ga ba'u nan ke eko ebo acin'o ga wu rayi wye be yangban yin etiabo ma. Akika Soko yi be kpikpe yan etun nanzhi e lo nan.
Surah 35:9    ,            It is Allah Who sends forth the Winds so that they raise up the Clouds and We drive them to a land that is dead and revive the earth therewith after its death: even so (will be) the Resurrection!,Soko gae tun efezhi tun'o u cia jin u la sanma cie shio gancin Yi cie da'ugwalo ezhi nan yi tsutsuci nan Yi cie la kin dan rayi baci nan u ga tsu nan. Acinga ga a nan ekunzhi kin kabaria bo.
Surah 35:10    ,                   If any do seek for glory and power- to Allah belong all glory and power. To Him mount up (all) Words of Purity: It is He Who exalts each Deed of Righteousness. Those that lay Plots of Evil- for them is a Penalty terrible; and the plotting of such will be void (of result).,Zandondo nan gae wa cin wan nan akika cinwan kpata egwa Soko bo u fio. Egan wangizhi mae laagun da eba'u U mae la etun wangizhi laatu za nanazhiy mae jin tanadi yan etun dedezhi nan azaba nan tan nan a jin tabbata ya'a tanadiazhi kpata ma u ga jin lalace.
Surah 35:11         ,                        And Allah did create you from dust; then from a sperm-drop; then He made you in pairs. And no female conceives or lays down (her load) but with His knowledge. Nor is a man long-lived granted length of days nor is a part cut off from his life but is in a Decree (ordained). All this is easy to Allah.,Soko ga jin halitta ye dagan jikannan bo gancin dagan maniy bo Ucia ye la fe bagi be ynzagiy. Ynzagi ndondo a la ewan'a U ma magia sai be kpikpe'u yin.

Surah 35:12  ,                         Nor are the two bodies of flowing water alike- the one palatable sweet and pleasant to drink and the other salt and bitter. Yet from each (kind of water) do ye eat flesh fresh and tender and ye extract ornaments to wear; and thou seest the ships therein that plough the waves that ye may seek (thus) of the Bounty of Allah that ye may be grateful.,Edu-nuwan guba a jin ninia; nana nuwan'u man sarauyin u ma fan'y fin nanan ma yi esan-esan luku lukuy.

Surah 35:13    ,                       He merges Night into Day and he merges Day into Night and he has subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law): each one runs its course for a term appointed. Such is Allah your Lord: to Him belongs all Dominion. And those whom ye invoke besides Him have not the least power.,Wun'e la yeshi a lo dan mini batin'o U mae la batin a lo dan mini yeshio. U ma igidi to etswa fozo ndondo mae dazan lo iyaka nan yi bibaci nan. Etsu nan'ejin nnan nan u gayi Soko nan yi Tsoci ye nao. Soko ga wun mulkio za nanzhi ye jin bauta ya baciu bo nan a de mulki yan gwargwado sun-sun dobina'a.
Surah 35:14      ,           If ye invoke them they will not listen to your call and if they were to listen they cannot answer your (prayer). On the Day of Judgment they will reject your "Partnership". and none (O man!) can tell thee (the Truth) like the One Who is acquainted with all things.,Ka ye ga'e yia e wo yiyi yezhia ka a ma ga wo a ya ye ezhe woa efo alkiyami ma a ga egwazhi wa be wiwo nan ye fe wo'a nan. A ma de za nan a ya wyo labari dozhin Etsu kpikpe naa.
Surah 35:15     ,    O ye men! It is ye that have need of Allah: but Allah is the One Free of all wants worthy of all praise.,Ya ye zawangizhi ye ga yi talakazhi lo eba Soko Soko ga ma yi Etsu ba--  Etsu nan zandondo e jin yebo ya nao.
Surah 35:16 ,    If He so pleased He could blot you out and bring in a New Creation.,U ga ba'u u gae tanfi baenio u cia kezhe jin halitta worozhi be.
Surah 35:17,    Nor is that (at all) difficult for Allah.,Wuncin ma jin eyan zwizwoci eba Soko boa.
Surah 35:18     ,                            Nor can a bearer of burdens bear another´s burdens if one heavily laden should call another to (bear) his load. Not the least portion of it can be carried (by the other). Even though he be nearly related. Thou canst but admonish such as fear their Lord unseen and establish regular Prayer. And whoever purifies himself does so for the benefit of his own soul; and the destination (of all) is to Allah.,Zando ma'a la kara lefi yan zandocia. Za nan ma kara zunubi'uzhi ga lukpin nan kau ga yi za gan a bau la re a bau yando la rea ka uga yi yegi nan tsoba nan. Wyo deo feo jin gangba'o ya za nanzhi gae sundan Tsocia swiswoci nan a ma kezhea Sallah kugikini nan.Zaeni ndondo nan ga tadzu ke shikan kafirinci lugwa nan wuncin yi ebo ti tacin'u bo eba Soko tsa yia kezhe lo kpatao.
Surah 35:19   ,The blind and the seeing are not alike;,Yebonci be za nan e le ba ye nan a jin ye nia.Surah 35:20   Nor are the depths of Darkness and the Light;Acinga bazhikozhi be haske a jin ye nia.
Surah 35:21   ,Nor are the (chilly) shade and the (genial) heat of the sun:,Ba yeko be ba yi pae a jin ye nia.
Surah 35:22   ,            Nor are alike those that are living and those that are dead. Allah can make any that He wills to hear; but thou canst not make those to hear who are (buried) in graves.,Acinga za nanzhi yi be rayi nan be za nanzhi'a tsu nan a jin ye nia. Akika Sokoe la gan-wo ya za nan ga ba'u nan. Wyo ma wyoa la za nanzhi fi kabario nan wo gan woa.
Surah 35:23  , Thou art no other than a warner.,Wyo de fea sai dai gangba jinci.
Surah 35:24   ,        Verily We have sent thee in truth as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner: and there never was a people without a warner having lived among them (in the past).,Akika Yi tun wyo tun-tun ganni be gaskiyae ebo wyo yaa labari yangbanfa wyo ma'o na'a wun akika mini al'umma ndondo eza danbo nan'e na'a wun nan.
Surah 35:25     ,       And if they reject thee so did their predecessors to whom came their messengers with Clear Signs Books of dark prophecies and the Book of Enlightenment.,A ma ga egan wyo yi ganmana za nanzhi shiadzo nan atso'a egan Tuciazhi yi ganmanan kaminan Tuciazhi be yaa be bayanizhi be hujja yan takadazhi be Litafi nan yi be haske nan.
Surah 35:26 ,     In the end did I punish those who rejected Faith: and how (terrible) was My rejection (of them)!,Gancin Mi cia za nanzhi ajin kafirinci nan wan ngba ke nangban yan etan winwan yan Soko yi nao
Surah 35:27  ,                   Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky With it We then bring out produce of various colours. And in the mountains are tracts white and red of various shades of colour and black intense in hue.,Ye le yea kendoe Sokoe du ele be dagan sanmao na'a Yi cia yangici sun-sunzhi la'atinya be ele iri yan sun-sunzhi ma yi kakayin. U ma ke jin dan mini patizhio ekohi nanzhiy yi bokun to dzuruzhiy nan atso ma yi iri kakayin ganni be ndocizhi nanzhi shizhiko sarauyin nan.
Surah 35:28      ,          And so amongst men and crawling creatures and cattle are they of various colours. Those truly fear Allah among His Servants who have knowledge: for Allah is Exalted in Might Oft-Forgiving.,To mini yan zawangizhio to dabbazhio to dabba yan emanwozhi atsozhi yi iri kakaayin acinga ayi baeni bo. Akika Manzhi gbaugi gae sundan Soko mini wuzhi'uzhi bo. Akika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu gafara.
Surah 35:29      ,         Those who rehearse the Book of Allah establish regular Prayer and spend (in Charity) out of what We have provided for them secretly and openly hope for a commerce that will never fail:,Akika za nanzhi egba litafi Soko nan ama sallah kugikini nan a mae wu dukiyazhi nan Yi la yaa nan fi eko wangizhio to swiswoci to gangbao nan akika za wuncinzhi e cewo nan a zunyaanan.
Surah 35:30   ,    For He will pay them their meed nay He will give them (even) more out of His Bounty: for He is Oft-Forgiving Most Ready to appreciate (service).,Ebo acin'o Soko ga lada'zhi shekpan yaa u ma'a kezhe bea mini falala'uzhio. Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yebo jin.
Surah 35:31      ,         That which We have revealed to thee of the Book is the Truth- confirming what was (revealed) before it: for Allah is assuredly- with respect to His Servants - well acquainted and Fully Observant.,Litafi nan tso Yi jin wahayi u be ya wyo nan wun ga yi gaskiya'o U maa gaskiya ya be nanzhi be shi'udzo nan. Akika Soko yi be kpikpe u mae le yannan wuzhi'uzhi dan'yn-ninbo nan ye.
Surah 35:32    ,                Then We have given the Book for inheritance to such of Our Servants as We have chosen: but there are among them some who wrong their own souls; some who follow a middle course; and some who are by Allah´s leave foremost in good deeds; that is the highest Grace.,Ganci yi cia Litafi laa gi gun ya eza tsitsacizhi mini wuzhi yi zhio ade miniabo nan'ejin ti tacin'u gun nan ama de nanzhi yi eza tacingizhi nan ama de nanzhi a shidzo be etu alhairizhi be yarda Sokoe nan.

Surah 35:34  ,        And they will say: "Praise be to Allah Who has removed from us (all) sorrow: for our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving Ready to appreciate (service):,Aci gan: Yebo kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko nan'a yangban-yin lakeyabo ya yi nan. Akika Tsoci yi Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yebo jin.
Surah 35:35  ,           "Who has out of His Bounty settled us in a Home that will last: no toil nor sense of weariness shall touch us therein.",Etsu nan'a yi cin fi emi yan danbo dan'o mini falala'u bo nan yia le wahala ndondo ye mini'u boa yi ma'awo ebo ndondo mini'u boa.
Surah 35:36 ,                But those who reject (Allah) - for them will be the Fire of Hell: No term shall be determined for them so they should die nor shall its Penalty be lightened for them. Thus do We reward every ungrateful one!,Za nanzhiy maa a jin kafirinci be Sokoe nan egagba yan enan jahannama wun'ajin tabbata ya'a a ga -- rayi beayin acia tsu'a  a ma'a jin sauki yan azaba ya'a.

Surah 35:37   ,                     Therein will they cry aloud (for assistance): "Our Lord! Bring us out: we shall work righteousness not the (deeds) we used to do!" - "Did We not give you long enough life so that he that would should receive admonition and (moreover) the warner came to you. So taste ye (the fruits of your deeds): for the wrong-doers there is no helper.",A ma fe yi kabara fi mini'u bo aafe gan gan: Ya wyo Tsoci yi!

Surah 35:38 ,        Verily Allah knows (all) the hidden things of the heavens and the earth: verily He has full knowledge of all that is in (men´s) hearts.,Akika Soko yi be kpikpe yan yannanzhi swo fi sanmazhio to kin bo nan.Akika Soko yi be kpikpe yan yannanzhi swo fi yangbanzhio nan.
Surah 35:39  ,                     He it is That has made you inheritors in the earth: if then any do reject (Allah) their rejection (works) against themselves: their rejection but adds to the odium for the Unbelievers in the sight of their Lord: their rejection but adds to (their own) undoing.,Soko ga la ye cia fe halifazhi kpe kinbo.

Surah 35:40 ,                               Say: "Have ye seen (these) ´Partners´ of yours whom ye call upon besides Allah Show Me what it is they have created in the (wide) earth. Or have they a share in the heavens Or have We given them a Book from which they (can derive) clear (evidence)- Nay the wrong-doers promise each other nothing but delusions.,Gan gan: Ye le ye'a za nanzhi ye la a pa mi baci nan ye cie jin bauta ya;a ke Soko lugwa nan e la'wu Mi yin kiy zhiy a jin halittau kpe eti kinbo kashi a pama ganni be Sokoe eba jin-jin yan sanmao kashi yi la Litafi ndoci la ya'a kayin nantso a fe hujja ya'a nan U jin acin'a akika azwalumizhi de a de yannanzhi e la jin dozhi alkawali na'a sai dai eta.
Surah 35:41     ,             It is Allah Who sustains the heavens and the earth lest they cease (to function): and if they should fail there is none - not one - can sustain them thereafter: Verily He is Most Forbearing Oft-Forgiving.,Akika Soko ga la egwa sun sanmazhi to kin aci du'a yin'o akika a ma ga du-du zaeni ndondo la egwa sun'u wo baci Soko boa. Akika Soko Etsu hakuri uyio Etsu gaafara uyio.
Surah 35:42 ,                 They swore their strongest oaths by Allah that if a warner came to them they would follow his guidance better than any (other) of the Peoples: But when a warner came to them it has only increased their flight (from righteousness)-,A ma zhi kuti be Sokoe iyaka yan kuti zhi'a zhi gan: Akika gangba jinci ga be ya'a a gaafe dan mini aluma nanzhi a gwo bawu gan zazhi nan kaminan gangba jinci be be yaanan u bea yandondoa sai de kpikpe-yai be bawu'y.
Surah 35:43   ,                      On account of their arrogance in the land and their plotting of Evil but the plotting of Evil will hem in only the authors thereof. Now are they but looking for the way the ancients were dealt with But no change wilt thou find in Allah´s way (of dealing): no turning off wilt thou find in Allah´s way (of dealing).,Ebo eti kagbo ta eti kinbo be makirinci dede U mae cin ta eti zando boa sai eti za nan'e jin'u nan.

Surah 35:44         ,                    Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them- though they were superior to them in strength Nor is Allah to be frustrated by anything whatever in the heavens or on earth: for He is All-Knowing. All-Powerful.,Kashi! E za-za kpe eti kinboa acia cin'ale a lo kendoe zoba yan zanazhi shiadzo nan yi-yi na'a a maafe gan a gboka gan'a. yandondo ma gan Soko gwaa dan mini sanmazhio ko kin boa.

Surah 35:45       ,                 If Allah were to punish men according to what they deserve. He would not leave on the back of the (earth) a single living creature: but He gives them respite for a stated Term: when their Term expires verily Allah has in His sight all His Servants.,Da agan Soko e din-ye-din wan zazhi be lefi'azhi da a de rayi ndondo ke ta eti kin boa amaade wyun'e pata ya'a da lokaci nan yi be iyakae nan.
