Surah 10:1 ,    A.L.R. These are the ayats of the Book of Wisdom.,Alif Lam Ra. Wuncinzhi aya yan litafi (Alkuranu) ayio na yi be hikimae na.
Surah 10:2       ,                  Is it a matter of wonderment to men that We have sent Our inspiration to a man from among themselves- that he should warn mankind (of their danger) and give the good news to the Believers that they have before their Lord the lofty rank of truth. (But) say the Unbelievers: "This is indeed an evident sorcerer!",Kashi wun'afe eyan mamaki fe ya zawangizhi na Yi ya'a wahayi jin ya eza bagi miniabo na kede "jin zawangizhi gangba wyo mao ya zanazhia imani jin na labari yangbanfa kede: ade kinigiba wanciko yan dzoshi dan eba Tsociabo na.

Surah 10:3      ,                      Verily your Lord is Allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days and is firmly established on the throne (of authority) regulating and governing all things. No intercessor (can plead with Him) except after His leave (hath been obtained). This is Allah your Lord; Him therefore serve ye: will ye not receive admonition,Hakika Tsoci ye uga yi Soko'o Etsu najin alita sanmazhi to kin dan mini eka yan fo gutsun'ayin'o na gancin ucia jin daidai ta eti Alarashio Ucie jin shiri alamarizhi (kendoe ga ba una).

Surah 10:4   ,                        To Him will be your return- of all of you. The promise of Allah is true and sure. It is He Who beginneth the process of creation and repeateth it that He may reward with justice those who believe and work righteousness; but those who reject Him will have draughts of boiling fluids and a penalty grievous because they did reject Him.,Eba'u gabo ezhe keba ye dan ba'eni bo alkawali Soko ma gaskiya uyio; Hakika Wyun ga yi Etsu nae ca jin jin alitta nao gancin Ucia kezhe u la'azheban zhin Efo Alkiyami ebo u la egagba'u ya zanazhia imani jin aci lo tun wan gi zhi na be adalinci; zanazhi maajin kafirinci na yi be eyan finci na wona sarauyin na be azaba na tan nae ebo kafirinci nazhi afe jin na.
Surah 10:5  ,                    It is He Who made the sun to be a shining glory and the moon to be a light (of beauty) and measured out stages for her; that ye might know the number of years and the count (of time). Nowise did Allah create this but in truth and righteousness. (Thus) doth He explain His Signs in detail for those who understand.,Wyun' ga la igidi cie ban-nao to etswa nae ya haske na ucia jin be ecin ba zhi ebo yede bae de kpikpe yan lisafi (yandondo). Soko jin wuncin zhi jin'a sai de eti gaskiyao. Umae kpe ayazhi ye kpe ya zanazhi ga yi eza kpikpe zhi na.
Surah 10:6       ,      Verily in the alternation of the night and the day and in all that Allah hath created in the heavens and the earth are signs for those who fear Him.,Hakika mini cice le ba yan yeshi to igidi to yannazhi Soko jin fi sanmazhio to kin bo na ayazhi danbo ya jama'a nazhi gae sundan Soko acie tswa'u na.
Surah 10:7    ,          Those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present and those who heed not Our Signs-,Hakika zanazhie sundan yan gun-gun be yi yin'a na acia yeda jin be emawo izhe na yangban'azhi ma'ashi be uyin na to to zanazhia ya ye ke aya Yizhi lugwa na.
Surah 10:8   ,  Their abode is the Fire because of the (evil) they earned.,Za wuncinzhi (kpata) ezhe ke ba'a uga yi enao ebo iri etun (dede) nazhi afe lo na.
Surah 10:9   ,           Those who believe and work righteousness- their Lord will guide them because of their faith: beneath them will flow rivers in gardens of bliss.,Hakika zanazhia imani jin na aci lo tun wangizhi na Tsocia wyun'a bea bawu be imania yin nuwan jijecizhi'afe je fi takoabo fi mini Aljannazhio nazhi yi emi ni'ima na.
Surah 10:10,             (This will be) their cry therein: "Glory to Thee O Allah!" And "Peace" will be their greeting therein! and the close of their cry will be: "Praise be to Allah the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds!",Aduwa na afe ba fi miniubo na "Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya wyoe Soko" emi sa'ama miniubo uga yi "SALAMUO". Aduwa yan zobaama uga yi "yebo kpata'a jin tabbata ya Soko Etsu nae kpa alittazhi kpata na.
Surah 10:11,                 If Allah were to hasten for men the ill (they have earned) as they would fain hasten on the good- then would their respite be settled at once. But We leave those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us in their trespasses wandering in distraction to and fro.,Da aci gan Sokoe din ye din be gwigwo aduwa dede zazhi'i kendoe wyun'e dinye be alheri'i yaana hakika da aga hukunci ba eti ajaliazhi boa ni ebo acin'o Yi ela zanazhie jin kauna yan gun-gun wangi be Yi yin'a na ya fi ragbanzhiazhio aci ga'azhi fi bo.
Surah 10:12    ,                      When trouble toucheth a man He crieth unto Us (in all postures)- lying down on his side or sitting or standing. But when We have solved his trouble he passeth on his way as if he had never cried to Us for a trouble that touched him! thus do the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes!,Kamina egun ga'a to za na wyu'a fe yi Yi ye ci elelebaubo koma edun feubo koma gbaroo.

Surah 10:13  ,              Generations before you We destroyed when they did wrong: their messengers came to them with clear-signs but they would not believe! thus do We requite those who sin!,Hakika Yi jin al'umma nazhi shiyedzo na hallaka lokacina afe jin zwalunci na Tuci'a zhi ma br ya'a be bayanizhi nazhia tu la na amaade ajin imania.

Surah 10:15,                                      But when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed unto them those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us Say: "Bring us a reading other than this or change this" Say: "It is not for me of my own accord to change it: I follow naught but what is revealed unto me: if I were to disobey my Lord I should myself fear the penalty of a Great Day (to come).",Ama gae gba aya Yi nazhia tula na ya'a za nazhie jin kauna gungun wangi be Yi yin'ana ajin agangan: "La kuranu ndoci beyn najin nana'ana koma u'sangwa "Gangan: U-- yin ya mi yin'a umajin kagbo mi yin'a na mia san'ugwa wo be ti mi yin na'a.

Surah 10:16,                 Say: "If Allah had so willed I should not have rehearsed it to you nor would He have made it known to you. A whole life-time before this have I tarried amongst you: will ye not then understand"Gangan: ",Wun'aba Soko ba da mia gba'u wo ya ye yea da mima'ala kpikpeu wu ye woa hakika mi fedun dan tacin yebo eya nazhi dokun na shidzo be dzo kafi wahayi'u be na.

Surah 10:17  ,           Who doth more wrong than such as forge a lie against Allah or deny His Signs But never will prosper those who sin.,Ngba zi'i wu'ye gan za nae tswa ganmana ta Soko nao koma ucia aya'uzhi yi ganmana nao Hakika le fi jin ci zhi'atso guria
Surah 10:18    ,                        They serve besides Allah things that hurt them not nor profit them and they say: "These are our intercessors with Allah."

Surah 10:19,                Mankind was but one nation but differed (later). Had it not been for a word that went forth before from thy Lord their differences would have been settled between them.,Zawangizhi (kpata) ma fea saide al'umma nini gancin acia cedozhi le ba kaujin ebo egan na'ashidzo dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo na'a da aga hukunci ba tsakaniabo eti yanazhie ce dozhi leba fi minubo na.
Surah 10:20,               They say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord" Say: "The Unseen is only for Allah (to know) then wait ye: I too will wait with you.",Acia jin afe gangan: ki'i la aci cin aya zankpe ndoci be yau dagan eba Tsoci u boa yin'o "Gangan: Hakika de (kpikpe) yanna swo kpata na be Soko yin'udan'o.

Surah 10:21,                     When We make mankind taste of some mercy after adversity hath touched them behold! they take to plotting against Our Signs! Say: "Swifter to plan is Allah!"

Surah 10:23   ,                     But when he delivereth them behold! they transgress insolently through the earth in defiance of right!

Surah 10:37  ,                   This Qur´an is not such as can be produced by other than Allah; on the contrary it is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before it and a fuller explanation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord of the worlds.,Alkuranu na na ma wun'aye jin na'agau tswa wo uma'ajin Sokoa na'a yin'a ammade litafi uyio nae wu gaskiya yabo yan litafi nazhi shidzona umae jin bayani hukunci nazhi fi litafio na kelokezhin ndondo danboa dagan eba Etsu nae kpa alitta zhi kpata na bo ufebo.

Surah 10:45     ,              One day He will gather them together: (It will be) as if they had tarried but an hour of a day: they will recognise each other: assuredly those will be lost who denied the meeting with Allah and refused to receive true guidance.,Fona ma uga kuaa yekan na uga'fe ke a fedun izhe lea sai de ke yan lokaci ndoci de'gi igidio na; acia kpe dozhi ye kanga.
