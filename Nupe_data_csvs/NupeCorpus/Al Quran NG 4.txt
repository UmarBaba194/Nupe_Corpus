Surah 4:1,   O mankind! reverence your Guardian-Lord who created you from a single person created of like nature His mate and from them twain scattered (like seeds) countless men and women;- reverence Allah through whom ye demand your mutual (rights)and (reverence) the wombs (That bore you): for Allah ever watches over you,Ya ye zawangizhi!

Surah 4:2  ,             To orphans restore their property (When they reach their age) nor substitute (your) worthless things for (their) good ones; and devour not their substance (by mixing it up) with your own. For this is indeed a great sin,Ye mae la dukiya ekungizhie lae ya'a ye mae ga la dedezhi a sangwa be wangizhi-ma. Ye mae ga gi dukiya'azhi alo dan mini dukiya yezhio ma. Akika wuncin wun'afe zunubi na wancin na.
 Surah 4:3 ,                          If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans Marry women of your choice Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them) then only one or (a captive) that your right hands possess that will be more suitable to prevent you from doing injustice,Ye ma gae sundan ke yea jin adalinci wo dan mini (yawo) ekungizhi boa na eda jin yawo na ga mafi ye na mini yizagizhio guba-guba be guta-gutae be gunni-gunniy.

Surah 4:4  ,           And give the women (on marriage) their dower as a free gift; but if they of their own good pleasure remit any part of it to you Take it and enjoy it with right good cheer ,Ye mae la swadaki yinzagizhie lae ya'a eryatwa yan wajibi. Gancin ma a ga be jin sauki yandoci yaye miniubo be banba yangban'ayin to egi'u be yangban tacin'y be emawoe.
Surah 4:5  ,             To those weak of understanding Make not over your property which Allah hath made a means of support for you but feed and clothe them therewith and speak to them words of kindness and justice,Ye mae ga la dukiya yezhi dangwa wawazhio ma dukiya na Sokoa kagbo yan kukugikini yezhi la'adanbo nama yede ya'agi ye mae jin tufuwazhie ya'a ye mae fe gangan yan alheri beayin.
Surah 4:6 ,                                    Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; if then ye find sound judgment in them release their property to them; but consume it not wastefully nor in haste against their growing up. If the guardian is well-off Let him claim no remuneration but if he is poor let him have for himself what is just and reasonable. When ye release their property to them take witnesses in their presence: But all-sufficient is Allah in taking account,Ye mae ma ekungizhie cin'ele har da lokaci na'aga kun yawo yin jin na. Yangban ye ga'ashi beayin ke a zhe eza bawu zhia ni na to yea dukiya'zhi la'a ya'. Ye mae ga giu be nyin nyin yae ma Ye mae ga wu'a yan be eye din'y kafi'a wancin na ma.

Surah 4:7  ,                From what is left by parents and those nearest related there is a share for men and a share for women whether the property be small or large-a determinate share,Bagizhi ayi be raboayin dagan mini yanna yanmanci guba'ba to yan dangi tsonbazhi ga lugwa zhi zumao na to yinzagizhi asto yi be robo'ayin dagan mini yanna yanmanci guba'ba to dangi yan tsonbazhi ga lugwa na. Mini yanna gba gba dan miniubo koma uci wancin na. Robo ma uyio na yi farilla na.
Surah 4:8 ,           But if at the time of division other relatives or orphans or poor are present feed them out of the (property) and speak to them words of kindness and justice,Kamina dangi yan tsonbazhi to ekungizhi to eza 'gwa gbagizhi agabe zhi ba na'agan gun nao na eya'a gi miniubo ye mae gangan yan alheri zhie ya'a.
Surah 4:9,              Let those (disposing of an estate) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own if they had left a helpless family behind: Let them fear Allah and speak words of appropriate (comfort),Zanazhi-ma ga'afe gan atso ga ya zuriya gbogun zhi zhi zumao a sundan ya'a (yan egbazhe dede na) za wuncinzhi atso a sundan Soko' ama'a gan gan natso yi gboro' na.
Surah 4:10 ,           Those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans eat up a Fire into their own bodies: They will soon be enduring a Blazing Fire!,Akika za nazhiegi dukiya ekungizhi eti zwaluncio na akika ena tsa zawuncinzhi'e gi fi gbako bo ama ga'a gan dan mini ena SAIRAO nae po sarauyina.
Surah 4:11,                                                                      Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children´s (Inheritance): to the male a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters two or more their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one her share is a half. For parents a sixth share of the inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children and the parents are the (only) heirs the mother has a third; if the deceased Left brothers (or sisters) the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases (´s) after the payment of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether your parents or your children are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-knowing Al-wise,Soko mae jin waswinci dan mini egi yezhio. Bagi wun'a de robo iri natso yi yan yinzagi guba na.

Surah 4:12,                                                                                       In what your wives leave your share is a half if they leave no child; but if they leave a child ye get a fourth; after payment of legacies and debts. In what ye leave their share is a fourth if ye leave no child; but if ye leave a child they get an eighth; after payment of legacies and debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants nor descendants but has left a brother or a sister each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two they share in a third; after payment of legacies and debts; so that no loss is caused (to any one). Thus is it ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-knowing Most Forbearing,Ye ma'ade ganfi yan yanna yinmi yezhi ga lugwa dan zumao na Kagan ade egia na amma'a aga yi be egi ye yeade kansan nini yan kansan gunni mini yannazhi a yadan zumao na baci yan waswinci na'uga jin na koma (gbata wo) yan gbata naugi na.

Surah 4:13 ,               Those are limits set by Allah: those who obey Allah and His Messenger will be admitted to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath to abide therein (for ever) and that will be the supreme achievement,Wuncin iyakazhi ayio yan Soko zandondo na ga emitu Soko be TuciU yin na Uga'u la'a gandan Aljinnazhio na nuwanzhie je fi takoabo na amafi bo fi tutunyin wuncin ga ma yi robo na wancin nao.
Surah 4:14,            But those who disobey Allah and His Messenger and transgress His limits will be admitted to a Fire to abide therein: And they shall have a humiliating punishment,Zandondo na ma gae le Soko be TuciU yin ba na ucie gwo iyakaUzhi gan na Uga'au la'a gandan enao Uma'agun bo gun tutunyin azaba yan egba maga'ajin tabbata yau
Surah 4:15,                     If any of your women are guilty of lewdness Take the evidence of four (Reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify confine them to houses until death do claim them or Allah ordain for them some (other) way,Za nazhi mae da lo 'tun alfasha mini yinzagi yezhio na to ewa erizhi zagunni dagan mini yetso' etiabo.

Surah 4:16,             If two men among you are guilty of lewdness punish them both. If they repent and amend Leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning Most Merciful,Bagi guba nazhi magae lo da jin alfa'sha na (luwati) ejin'a gun Gancin aga bea tuba jin acia alamariazhi tadzu yea dzu gan'abo.

Surah 4:17,                  Allah accept the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent soon afterwards; to them will Allah turn in mercy: For Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom,Akika tuba natso yi gwigwoci eba Soko na uyi ya zanazhi gae lo tun dede eti jahilincio na gancin (na'abea kpe na) acie jin tuba vava yin nao. Zawuncinzhi ga Sokoe gwo tuba'ao. Soko ma'afe Etsu kpikpe Etsu hikima.
Surah 4:18 ,                      Of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil until death faces one of them and he says "Now have I repented indeed;" nor of those who die rejecting Faith: for them have We prepared a punishment most grievous,Ujin tuba u yia na ezazhia fe lo 'tun dedezhi har da lokaci na ajali a be ya zaenia naa.

Surah 4:19  ,                               O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness that ye may Take away part of the dower ye have given them-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing and Allah brings about through it a great deal of good.

Surah 4:20,                But if ye decide to take one wife in place of another even if ye had given the latter a whole treasure for dower Take not the least bit of it back: Would ye take it by slander and manifest wrong,Ye ma gae be kpa gan yea san yinmi gwa kinigiba yan yinmi ndoncio alali ma ye la dukiya yan "kindari" (ewo bididi uyio) ya zae ni miniabo ega gwo yandondo miniubo ma.

Surah 4:22,                And marry not women whom your fathers married- except what is past: It was shameful and odious- an abominable custom indeed,Ye mae gada pa yawo be yinzagi nazhi baba yezhi jin yawo be yin nama sai de natsoa gwogan'a ni na.

Surah 4:24 ,                                        Also (prohibited are) women already married except those whom your right hands possess: Thus hath Allah ordained (Prohibitions) against you: Except for these all others are lawful provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property- desiring chastity not lust seeing that ye derive benefit from them give them their dowers (at least) as prescribed; but if after a dower is prescribed agree Mutually (to vary it) there is no blame on you and Allah is All-knowing All-wise,(Mini nazhi yi haramu be na) yinzagi nazhia yawo jin'a ni na sai de na egwa gwalo ye gaejin mulki na.

Ye are one from another: Wed them with the leave of their owners and give them their dowers according to what is reasonable: They should be chaste not lustful nor taking paramours: when they are taken in wedlock if they fall into shame their punishment is half that for free women. This (permission) is for those among you who fear sin; but it is better for you that ye practise self-restraint. And Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Za na ma be de bagwo na uga'ajin yawo yan yinzagi kiriki Muminizhi woa na to (a jin yawo) dagan mini yinzagi nazhi gwaloazhie jin mulki be yin na yinzagi wuzhizhi na zhi yi Muminizhi na.

Surah 4:26 ,            Allah doth wish to make clear to you and to show you the ordinances of those before you; and (He doth wish to) turn to you (In Mercy): And Allah is All-knowing All-wise,Sokoe kpa kpa gan Wyun'ula bayaniU jin'u yaye Uma'au wuyeba'u ta eti ekpa wangizhi yan za nazhi shi ye dzo na Uma u gwo tuba jin yan ye.

Surah 4:33  ,                To (benefit) every one We have appointed shares and heirs to property left by parents and relatives.

Surah 4:34 ,                                      Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in (the husband´s) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct admonish them (first) (Next) refuse to share their beds (And last) beat them (lightly); but if they return to obedience seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High great (above you all),Bagizhi agayi eye ladancizhi yan yinzagizhio ebo falala na Soko laya sashiazhi ta eti yan sashio na to ebo yannazhi e'wu dagan mini dukiya'azhio na.

Surah 4:40,              Allah is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good (done) He doubleth it and giveth from His own presence a great reward,Akika Sokoe jin gun'a ka wun'a yi yan gwargwado zarra'a wun'a yi etun wangi ga eza lo' Uga la'adazhi kpeba dozhi yan Ucia ke'la egagba na wancin na a yan dagan eba Wyuntso.
Surah 4:41,          How then if We brought from each people a witness and We brought thee as a witness against these people!,To ke wun'a yiyi nao Yi ga eri la'a tinya dagan mini aluman dondo Yici kezhea wyo la'tin ya ebo wyo lao fe eriota eti zanana zhio-nao.
Surah 4:42,             On that day those who reject Faith and disobey the messenger will wish that the earth Were made one with them: But never will they hide a single fact from Allah!,Fo wuncin za nazhia jin kafirinci acie le Tuci (Soko) ba na a'wa gan ala a yea la'azhe ye'ni be jikannae a ma la labari ndondo swo Soko woa.
Surah 4:43  ,                                             O ye who believe! Approach not prayers with a mind befogged until ye can understand all that ye say- nor in a state of ceremonial impurity (Except when travelling on the road) until after washing your whole body. If ye are ill or on a journey or one of you cometh from offices of nature or ye have been in contact with women and ye find no water then take for yourselves clean sand or earth and rub therewith your faces and hands. For Allah doth blot out sins and forgive again and again,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega kara tsoba jin jin swalla kamina ye ga'pe na ma sai ye ga kpe yanna yeye'gan na . Acinga ga mao kamina yega yi be janabae na sai de za na ga ta eti zan'o na sai ye'la nuwa'efu be'dzo.

Surah 4:44,             Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were given a portion of the Book they traffic in error and wish that ye should lose the right path,Ngba wyo ta ye leyea lo eba za nazhiala robo ya mini Litafio na'a e'da shi egbin acie wagan ye'lae gbin eke ekoe lugwa naa.
Surah 4:45 ,       But Allah hath full knowledge of your enemies: Allah is enough for a protector and Allah is enough for a Helper,Soko-otso ma kpe makiri yezhiye gan Zandondo. Soko ma'a kunke yan Ndakata Soko ma'akunke Taimako jinci.
Surah 4:46,                                     Of the Jews there are those who displace words from their (right) places and say: "We hear and we disobey"; and "Hear what is not Heard"; and "Ra´ina"; with a twist of their tongues and a slander to Faith. If only they had said: "What hear and we obey"; and "Do hear"; and "Do look at us"; it would have been better for them and more proper; but Allah hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe,Mini za nazhi yi Yahuduzhi na ade nazhie la egan zhegba ke dan na'a lugwa na. Acie gan gan:Yi wo yi ma navo wyo mao wo umau ga yi wuwoci ma Wyomao tswa yi acie zhegan gba be gin tara'zhi amae gan gan dedezhi dan mini adinio.

Surah 4:47,                           O ye People of the Book! believe in what We have (now) revealed confirming what was (already) with you before We change the face and fame of some (of you) beyond all recognition and turn them hindwards or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers for the decision of Allah Must be carried out,Ya ye nazhia la Litafi ya na!

Alamari Soko ma yan na etun ga'lo na Uyio.
Surah 4:48,                   Allah forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else to whom He pleaseth; to set up partners with Allah is to devise a sin Most heinous indeed,Akika Sokoe fa na eza'ala yandonci a'pau baci na; Umae fa be ndoci yan wuncin'y be za na gabaU na zandondo na ma gae la yan pa Soko baci na akika zawuncin'a le'fi na wancin na tswa.
Surah 4:49 ,            Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who claim sanctity for themselves Nay-but Allah Doth sanctify whom He pleaseth. But never will they fail to receive justice in the least little thing,Ngba wyo le za nazhie li 'ti tacin'a na yea A'a Sokoe tsae li za na ga baU nao. Amma'a jin'a zwalunci ka wun'a gbagba'a.
Surah 4:50 ,        Behold! how they invent a lie against Allah! but that by itself is a manifest sin!,Wyotso cinle kendoe e'tswa ganmana ta Soko na! Wuncin ma'kun le'fi na'atu la na.
Surah 4:51 ,                  Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were given a portion of the Book they believe in sorcery and Evil and say to the Unbelievers that they are better guided in the (right) way Than the believers!Ngba wyo ta ye le ye lo eba za nazhia la robo ya mini Litafio na'a Gancin acie da jin imani be kutizhiy to be Shetan (nae tswa ganmana ta Soko na) acie gan be za nazhia jin kafirinci na; "Za na nazhi a kpe eko bawuo gan za nazhi gan a imani jin na."
Surah 4:52  ,       They are (men) whom Allah hath cursed: And those whom Allah Hath cursed thou wilt find have no one to help,Za wuncinzhi ga Soko bo 'mio za ndondo na ma Soko ga'bo 'mi na wun'ade zandondo na'ajin'u taimako na'a.
Surah 4:53 ,        Have they a share in dominion or power Behold they give not a farthing to their fellow-men,Kashi ade gwa ndoci dedan mulki jin'o Gancin ma a la ka kpara dobina twarya ya zazhi woa.
Surah 4:54 ,                Or do they envy mankind for what Allah hath given them of his bounty but We had already given the people of Abraham the Book and Wisdom and conferred upon them a great kingdom,Kashi e'jin zawangizhi hasada jin be eryatwa yan Soko na Ula ya'a na Akika yi la Litafi be Hakimae ya za 'mi Ibrahimazhi Yi ma ke'la mulki na wancin na ya'a.
Surah 4:55 ,         Some of them believed and some of them averted their faces from him: And enough is Hell for a burning fire,Ama de dan minabo za na' imani jin na a ma de na'a pan ya ke'u lugwa na Uma'a kunke be Jahannamae ma' gun na fia na.
Surah 4:56                   Those who reject our Signs We shall soon cast into the Fire: as often as their skins are roasted through We shall change them for fresh skins that they may taste the penalty: for Allah is Exalted in Power Wise,Akika  za nazhia jin kafirinci be aya Yi zhi-na be le'yin Yi ga'la gandan enao kandondo na epa'azhi ga'gyena na Yi ga epandoncizhi sangwa ya'a ebo atsoa fin azaba. Akika Soko Etsu zankpe Uyio Etsu hikima Uyio.
Surah 4:57  ,                 But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness We shall soon admit to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath- their eternal home: Therein shall they have companions pure and holy: We shall admit them to shades cool and ever deepening,Za nazhi ma imani jin na aci lotun wangi wangizhi na Yi ga'la gandan Aljannazhio na nuwanzhie je fi takoubo na ama' fibo tutun yin ama'a yi be yinmi lilicizhi fi bo.

Surah 4:58 ,                       Allah doth command you to render back your Trusts to those to whom they are due; And when ye judge between man and man that ye judge with justice: Verily how excellent is the teaching which He giveth you! For Allah is He Who heareth and seeth all things,Akika Soko jin foro gan ye'la amaanazhie lae ya za nazhi ga wun yan'a na . Ye ma ga'jin hukunci tsakani zawangizhio ejin hukunci be adalinciy. Akika Soko ga'wa'ama be yanna Wyun'e la'ajinye wa'azi na. Akika Soko'afe Etsu nae wo yandondo na Etsu na mae le yandondo ye na.
Surah 4:59,                           O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those charged with authority among you. If ye differ in anything among yourselves refer it to Allah and His Messenger if ye do believe in Allah and the Last Day: That is best and most suitable for final determination,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Yea emi tu Soko  Yamae la'mie tu Tuci (Soko) to za nazhi Soko la alamari yezhi fi gwa'bo mini yetso zhio na.

Surah 4:60 ,                           Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who declare that they believe in the revelations that have come to thee and to those before thee Their (real) wish is to resort together for judgment (in their disputes) to the Evil One though they were ordered to reject him. But Satan´s wish is to lead them astray far away (from the right),Kashi wyo ta'ye cinle lo eba za nazhie la wu ke a imani jin be yanna acin be ya wyo na; to be yan na a-cin be shi wyo dzo na gancin acie wagan afea la kara'alo eba yan Dagutu (za na tswa ganmana ta Soko na ) alali ma akika ajin'a foro gan a'la'jin kafirinci be uyin shetan cie wa gan wyun'u la'ugbin egbin na ma'akpeya na.
Surah 4:61,              When it is said to them: "Come to what Allah hath revealed and to the Messenger": Thou seest the Hypocrites avert their faces from thee in disgust,A ma ga gan'a gan: "E da be ye be'tsun' yan na soko cin be na to eba Tuci (Soko)" wyoa le munafikizhi ye e'kan zawangizhi ke eba wyo lugwa kinkan yan baeni.
Surah 4:62,               How then when they are seized by misfortune because of the deeds which they hands have sent forth Then their come to thee swearing by Allah: "We meant no more than good-will and conciliation!",To ke wun'a yiyi nao kamina masi'ba ndoci ga bea tswan'a ebo ebo etun dede na egwa'atso zhi la shidzo nao gancin acia dabe eba wyoe afe zhikuti be Sokoe gan: Yikpa yandondoa sai de bolobolo be gboro dae.
Surah 4:63 ,              Those men-Allah knows what is in their hearts; so keep clear of them but admonish them and speak to them a word to reach their very souls,Zawuncinzhi gayi za nazhi Soko tsa kpe yannazhi fi yangban'azhio nao. Ebo acin'o a dzugan'abo wyo mao jin'a gangba wyo mao gan gan fasahazhi nazhi lukpin naofi yangban'azhio.
Surah 4:64,                      We sent not a messenger but to be obeyed in accordance with the will of Allah. If they had only when they were unjust to themselves come unto thee and asked Allah´s forgiveness and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them they would have found Allah indeed Oft-returning Most Merciful,Yima tun Tuci ndondo tuntun'a sai de ebo (ezazhi ) a la miatu'U be izini Sokoe. Da'aci gan be akikae kamina aga etitacin'a jin zwalunci na adabe eba wyoe gancin aci ba gafara be sokoe Tuci (Soko) otso ci ba gafara be ya'a akika da ayea tsun Soko Etsu nae gwo tuba na Etsu nayi Etsu yegun na.
Surah 4:65 ,                 But no by the Lord they can have no (real) Faith until they make thee judge in all disputes between them and find in their souls no resistance against Thy decisions but accept them with the fullest conviction.A'a Mie zhi kuti be Tsocio yin imania wun'ajin yan gaskiya'a har sai aga yedajin be hukunci wyo yin dan yan nazhi ga celeba dan tsakaniabo be dozhi-na gancin ama'a ga wo bapin ndoci dan yangban'azhio mini hukunci ndondo na wyo ga ba nao ma ama'ala kpatsun'ata'aya Soko baenio.
Surah 4:66  ,                       If We had ordered them to sacrifice their lives or to leave their homes very few of them would have done it: But if they had done what they were (actually) told it would have been best for them and would have gone farthest to strengthen their (faith);Da'aci gan be akikae Yi yiu la'ajin wajibi ta etiabo gan: Yea eti tacin'e wu ko ma yea dzun tinya dagan emiezhio da ajin wun'a sai de za de'gi minia bo. Da'aci gan be akikae ma e'lo 'tun be yanna e'lajin'a wa'azi na da'wun'afe alheri ya'agan u ma'a ke yaa kagbo gan eba kinigi bao.
Surah 4:67  ,   And We should then have given them from our presence a great reward;Da kanga ma be akikae Yiola la'ada na wancin na ya'a dagan eba Yi bo.
Surah 4:68 , And We should have shown them the Straight Way,Da ma Yi ga'wuba ta eko natso yi gboro na. 
Surah 4:69 ,                All who obey Allah and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allah- of the prophets (who teach) the sincere (lovers of Truth) the witnesses (who testify) and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!,Zandondo ma na ga emitu Soko be Tuciy na to zawuncinzhi a ga'panba be za nazhi Soko twarya ni'imau ya mini Annabizhio to za na zhie dokun be gaskiya yae na be za nazhie de tsu tsu yan eri (ekundao na) be za guruzhiy.

Surah 4:70,      Such is the bounty from Allah: And sufficient is it that Allah knoweth all.Wuncin ma falala uyio dagan eba Soko Soko ma'kunke be kpikpe ndondoe.
Surah 4:71,         O ye who believe! Take your precautions and either go forth in parties or go forth all together,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! E tswa shiri yan ekun yezhi gancin yecie tin'e yae dan kun'o jama jamazhi ko ma ye' tin'eya baenio.
Surah 4:72,                There are certainly among you men who would tarry behind: If a misfortune befalls you they say: "Allah did favour us in that we were not present among them.",Akika ma ade dan mini yebo zanazhie dingun zhin zuma na. Masiba ndoci ga'a tswan ye U gan: Akika boye yan Soko ta eti mi bo ebo na midan beayin ekunda boa-na.
Surah 4:73  ,               But if good fortune comes to you from Allah they would be sure to say - as if there had never been Ties of affection between you and them - "Oh! I wish I had been with them; a fine thing should I then have made of it!",Akika ma Wyun'ayi eryatwako yan Soko ndoci yeda deo kanga wun'afe gan gan: ke wyoa gan gan bo ye ndondo dan tsakani yebo lea na: ka'sa re!

Surah 4:74,                    Let those fight in the cause of Allah Who sell the life of this world for the hereafter. To him who fighteth in the cause of Allah- whether he is slain or gets victory - Soon shall We give him a reward of great (value),Zanazhi gae kun izhe ebo ade eku na a na'akin'a gunkun'a dan eko Soko' zandondo na gae gunkun dan eko Soko'na aci Uwu na ko ma wyun'a de galaba na to be le'yin Yia ya'U la'da na wancin na.
Surah 4:75,                              And why should ye not fight in the cause of Allah and of those who being weak are ill-treated (and oppressed)- Men women and children whose cry is: "Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from thee one who will protect; and raise for us from thee one who will help!",Ki mae jin ye yeo Yecie gunkun dan eko Soko boa na'a yin'o Alali ma za nazhi a togbogun mini bagizhio to yinzagizhi to egizhi na e'gan gan: Tsoci yi!

Surah 4:76 ,                  Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah and those who reject Faith Fight in the cause of Evil: So fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan,Za nazhia imani jin na egun kun dan eko Soko za nazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na e'gunkun dan eko Dagutuo (za nae tswa ganmana ta Soko na). Ebo acin'o egun masoyi shetan zhi kun akika tanadi shetan gbogun uyio.
Surah 4:77 ,                                              Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands (from fight) but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity When (at length) the order for fighting was issued to them behold! a section of them feared men as - or even more than - they should have feared Allah: They said: "Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordered us to fight Wouldst Thou not Grant us respite to our (natural) term near (enough)" Say: "Short is the enjoyment of this world: the Hereafter is the best for those who do right: Never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least!,Kashi wyo ta ye cinle lo eba za nazhi agan ya' gan: Yea egwaezhi wandan (ke ekun lugwa) Ye mae la swallae ku kigini yemae fe'ya zakka na'a Gancin kamina abea ekun la'jin wajibi ta etiabo na sashi miniabo cie sundan zawangizhi ke dasun Soko na ko ma na gan'acin na.

Surah 4:78 ,                                  "Wherever ye are death will find you out even if ye are in towers built up strong and high!" If some good befalls them they say "This is from Allah"; but if evil they say "This is from thee" (O Prophet). Say: "All things are from Allah." But what hath come to these people that they fail to understand a single fact,Ban dondo na ye ga da dan na tsutsu'a tsun'e bagao kadama yega'fe gun mini ekpakozhio na'atu tsankuy lo sama na. Alheri ndoci ma ga'a dea a'gan gan: "Nana eba Soko bo ufe beo" Egun ndoci maga tswan'a agan gan: Nana eba wyoe bo ufe beo' Gan gan: "kpata eba Soko boa fe beo". To ki-ma jin za nana zhi acie jin fahimta egan'a yan'o.
Surah 4:79 ,                Whatever good (O man!) happens to thee is from Allah; but whatever evil happens to thee is from thy (own) soul. and We have sent thee as a messenger to (instruct) mankind. And enough is Allah for a witness,Yandondo na ga tswan wye yan alhe'ri na dagan eba Soko bo' yan na ma ga tswan wye yan egun na dagan eba wyotso bo ufe beo Yi ma tun wyo tuntun wyo lao fe Tuci (Soko) lo eba zawangizhi. Soko ma'a kunke Etsu eri.
Surah 4:80 ,          He who obeys the Messenger obeys Allah: But if any turn away We have not sent thee to watch over their (evil deeds),Zandondo naga emitu Tuci na akika wyun'a emitu Soko dan'o na za na ma ga zuma zheta na to Yi tun wyo tun fia gan wyo feo tswa'ao za'a.
Surah 4:81,                       They have "Obedience" on their lips; but when they leave thee a section of them Meditate all night on things very different from what thou tellest them. But Allah records their nightly (plots): So keep clear of them and put thy trust in Allah and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs,Acia fe gan gan: "Yi gwo yima' emitu". Gancin aga tinya dagan eba wyobo sashi miniabo a da le le be yandoci- dan yangban'o na'a ce leba natso wyo gan na.

Surah 4:82 ,          Do they not consider the Qur´an (with care) Had it been from other Than Allah they would surely have found therein Much discrepancy,Kashi e'kpaye nashidu nakpa dan alamari Alkuranu boa da' wun'ayi eba zandoci najin sokoa na bo ufe beo daatsun cice lebazhi dokun fi miniubo.Surah 4:83                             When there comes to them some matter touching (Public) safety or fear they divulge it. If they had only referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them the proper investigators would have Tested it from them (direct). Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of Allah unto you all but a few of you would have fallen into the clutches of Satan.Alamari ndoci maga beya'a yan aminci ko ma yan dansun ajin afe da ga'u miba za.

Surah 4:84   ,                  Then fight in Allah´s cause - Thou art held responsible only for thyself - and rouse the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the Unbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment,Ebo acin'o fe gun kun ta eti eko Soko a ma'ala kpakp ndoci a ta wyo ya'a sai yan eti tacin wyotso. Wyo ma'oya Muminizhi kwadari. Kengi uyio na Soko'a kangwa egun kafirizhi na Soko ma gbota gan eba egun la tswan zao. Soko ma gbota gan eba azaba jin'o.
Surah 4:85 ,                    Whoever recommends and helps a good cause becomes a partner therein: And whoever recommends and helps an evil cause shares in its burden: And Allah hath power over all things,Zandondo na ga tangwa ya za gwatan wangi na wyuntso'ade robo miniubo zandondo na ma ga tangwa ya za gwatan dede na tsunwan ndoci a danbo yan wuntso mini'ubo ma. Soko ma'afe Etsu nae dan lokaci kangi ta eti yandondo na.
Surah 4:86 ,            When a (courteous) greeting is offered you meet it with a greeting still more courteous or (at least) of equal courtesy. Allah takes careful account of all things,Ama ga be ci saye mi be emisa ndociy to ye' sa'aega be natso ga gyegan wuncin na ko ma e' sa'aga be iri natso a saye na. Akika Soko'afe Etsu nae la lisafi eti yandondo na.
Surah 4:87  ,              Allah! There is no god but He: of a surety He will gather you together against the Day of Judgment about which there is no doubt. And whose word can be truer than Allah´s,Soko ade Tsoci ndocia sai wyin' akika Ugae kuyekan da ' Efo Alkiyami kelo kezhin ndondo ma dan mini'uboa. Zi-ma ta gaskiya a gan Soko eba labari ya bo.
Surah 4:88  ,                   Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites Allah hath upset them for their (evil) deeds. Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way never shalt thou find the Way,To ki-jin ye yeo dan mini alamari munafikizhibo har yecia sa fi ena gubao alali ma Sokoa'gbin'ani ebo woce dede naa ce nao Kashi ye' wawa gan ye'la za na Sokoagbin nae lae ke eko Zandondo na ma Soko gaubgin na eko ndoci ke yaU bea.
Surah 4:89 ,                          They but wish that ye should reject Faith as they do and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks,E'jin gan ye' laejin kafirinci kendoe ajin kafirinci na ebo ye' laezhe ye'ni.

Surah 4:90 ,                                  Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty (of peace) or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. If Allah had pleased He could have given them power over you and they would have fought you: Therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not and (instead) send you (Guarantees of) peace then Allah Hath opened no way for you (to war against them),Sai de za nazhi ga'ada gun be jama'a ndocizhi-na nazhi-ma tsakani yebo bea yin alkawali danbo na ko ma za nazhi gabe eba ye be yangban wiwanci' na ke aya'a gun ye kun'a ama'a gun to zaba'a tsozhi kun'a na.

Surah 4:91,                              Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that of their people: Every time they are sent back to temptation they succumb thereto: if they withdraw not from you nor give you (guarantees) of peace besides restraining their hands seize them and slay them wherever ye get them: In their case We have provided you with a clear argument against them,Ye ma'ke' tsun zandocizhi be e'wa gan ye' ya'a aminci ye mae ya jama'a yan'azhi edunfe yan aminci.

Surah 4:92,                                                           Never should a believer kill a believer; but (If it so happens) by mistake (Compensation is due): If one (so) kills a believer it is ordained that he should free a believing slave and pay compensation to the deceased´s family unless they remit it freely. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you and he was a believer the freeing of a believing slave (Is enough). If he belonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance compensation should be paid to his family and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means (is prescribed) a fast for two months running: by way of repentance to Allah: for Allah hath all knowledge and all wisdom,Uma gwoyin na Muminizhi (muslumi) a wu Mumini na'a sai de eti bicicin'o.

Surah 4:93,              If a man kills a believer intentionally his recompense is Hell to abide therein (For ever): And the wrath and the curse of Allah are upon him and a dreadful penalty is prepared for him,Zandondo nama ga Musulumi wu digangae nato egagba'u yi Ena Jahanama bagabo wyun'a gun tutunyin'o Soko ma'azhe wun be'u yin uma'U bo''mi Uma shiri jin kau yan azaba na wancin na.
Surah 4:94,                                      O ye who believe! When ye go abroad in the cause of Allah investigate carefully and say not to any one who offers you a salutation: "Thou art none of a believer!" Coveting the perishable goods of this life: with Allah are profits and spoils abundant. Even thus were ye yourselves before till Allah conferred on you His favours: Therefore carefully investigate. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Yega tinya dan ezan'o eti ekun gun dan eko soko e wa bayani za sarauyin ye mae ga gan be zandondo na gajin ye sallama gan: wyo jin Musulumia ma.

Surah 4:95 ,                               Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward,Za nazhi fedun'azhizhi mini Musulumizhio aci lo ekun gunzhia naUmayi be uzuri kpoki yin'a na a jin ye'ni be za nazhie gun kun dan eko Soko be dukiya'azhi to be rayiazhi na laa ta eti za nazhi zhizhi na be daraja na wancin nae.

Surah 4:96,       Ranks specially bestowed by Him and Forgiveness and Mercy. For Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Darajazhi ayio dagan eba Soko be gafarae be yegun'y Soko ma'afe Etsu gafara Etsu yegun.
Surah 4:97,                          When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls they say: "In what (plight) Were ye" They reply: "Weak and oppressed Were we in the earth." They say: "Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to move yourselves away (From evil)" Such men will find their abode in Hell- What an evil refuge! ,Akika za nazhi Malaikazhie gwo rayiazhi na alali ma a fe dan hali yan za nazhia eti tacin'a jin gun na acie gan gan: "Hali kici ye dan'y ninbo" Acim gan: "Yi ya 'fe za nazhi a to gbogun fi kinbo na" Aci gan: "Asa kin yan Soko ujin gwugwo cia na ye'a kpela fi bo na'a" To zawuncinzhi ezhe keba'a yi Ena Jahannama. Ezhe keba wuncin ma'a bi ye.
Surah 4:98 ,          Except those who are (really) weak and oppressed - men women and children - who have no means in their power nor (a guide-post) to their way,Sai de zanazhi aga'a la to gbogun mini bagizhio to yinzagizhi to egizhi nama ade dabara ndondoa ama kpe eko ndoci ye na'ada na'a na.
Surah 4:99,         For these there is hope that Allah will forgive: For Allah doth blot out (sins) and forgive again and again.Zawuncizhi kengi uyio na Sokoa fa beayin na. Soko'ma wyun'afe Etsu fifa Etsu gafara.
Surah 4:100 ,                             He who forsakes his home in the cause of Allah finds in the earth Many a refuge wide and spacious: Should he die as a refugee from home for Allah and His Messenger His reward becomes due and sure with Allah: And Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Zandondo na gae kpela dan eko Soko na wyun'a tsun ebazhi na dokun na fi kinbo ganni be bagwae.

Surah 4:101,                      When ye travel through the earth there is no blame on you if ye shorten your prayers for fear the Unbelievers May attack you: For the Unbelievers are unto you open enemies,Ye ma gabea lodan ezan'o ta kin bo to le'fi danbo ya ye na ye ga (raka'a) swallazhi ke na'a ye gae sundan gan kafirizhi a'jin ye fitina na.

Surah 4:102 ,                                                            When thou (O Messenger) art with them and standest to lead them in prayer Let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with thee Taking their arms with them: When they finish their prostrations let them Take their position in the rear. And let the other party come up which hath not yet prayed - and let them pray with thee Taking all precaution and bearing arms: the Unbelievers wish if ye were negligent of your arms and your baggage to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if ye put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because ye are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the Unbelievers Allah hath prepared a humiliating punishment,Wyo ma ga'afe dan miniabo a swalla ku gikini bea yin to kansan ndoci miniabo abea gikini be wyo yin ama'ala gwa'asun kaya 'kun'azhi.

Surah 4:103,                   When ye pass (Congregational) prayers celebrate Allah´s praises standing sitting down or lying down on your sides; but when ye are free from danger set up Regular Prayers: For such prayers are enjoined on believers at stated times,Gancin yega bea swallah jin zo to e fe'tun Soko ye gbaro bao to edunfe bao to kamina yega kansan yezhi cici na. Gancin yangban yezhi ga bea shi to yea swallahzi ku gikini. Akika salla jin wun'afe wajibi ta eti Muminizhio dan lokaci na yibe kangi-na.
Surah 4:106,      But seek the forgiveness of Allah; for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.Wyo mao wa gafara Soko. Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 4:107,             Contend not on behalf of such as betray their own souls; for Allah loveth not one given to perfidy and crime,Wyo mao ga gbo'mi ya za nazhie jin eti tacin'a ha'inci na ma. Akika Sokoe wa zanae dokun be ha'inci jin'y na'a Umae wa za nae dokun be le'fi jin'y na'a.
Surah 4:108 ,                   They may hide (Their crimes) from men but they cannot hide (Them) from Allah seeing that He is in their midst when they plot by night in words that He cannot approve: And Allah Doth compass round all that they do,A' jin afe' wa gna'a swoa ya zawangizhi amae wa gan a swo'a ya sokoa ala'li ma Soko dan beayin lokaci na afe lele be yannazhi Soko jin yeda be yin'a na dan yangban'o na mae gan tinya na. Soko ma'afe Etsu na yannazhi e'jin kpata na makezhe na.
Surah 4:109,                 Ah! These are the sort of men on whose behalf ye may contend in this world; but who will contend with Allah on their behalf on the Day of Judgment or who will carry their affairs through,Ye ga dan nao ye gayi za nazhie gbo mi ya'a dan edunfe izhebo na to zidanbo na'agbomi ya'a Efo Alkiyami nao Kashi zia gikini yan wakili yaao.
Surah 4:110,            If any one does evil or wrongs his own soul but afterwards seeks Allah´s forgiveness he will find Allah Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Zandondo na ma ga lo 'tun dede na ko ma ucia eti tacin'u jin zwalunci na gancin uci wa gafara Soko wyun'a tsun Soko Etsu gafara Etsu yegun.
Surah 4:111,          And if any one earns sin. he earns it against His own soul: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom,Zandondo na ma ga da cewo zunubi na to eti tacin'u tsa wyun'e ce yao (uma'wu yan yau). Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 4:112 ,            But if any one earns a fault or a sin and throws it on to one that is innocent He carries (on himself) (Both) a falsehood and a flagrant sin,Zandondo na ma ga da cewo bibici na ko ma yan le'fi na gancin Uci dau ce ta zana yandotoa nato akika wyun'a kara yan ganmana tswitswaci la ganni be le'fi na'a tula na.
Surah 4:113,                                But for the Grace of Allah to thee and his Mercy a party of them would certainly have plotted to lead thee astray. But (in fact) they will only Lead their own souls astray and to thee they can do no harm in the least. For Allah hath sent down to thee the Book and wisdom and taught thee what thou Knewest not (before): And great is the Grace of Allah unto thee,Ka'ujinmebo falala yan Soko na ta eti wyo bo be yegun'U yin na'a da ndocizhi a jin kokari gan a la wyo ya'agbin.

Surah 4:114,                         In most of their secret talks there is no good: But if one exhorts to a deed of charity or justice or conciliation between men (Secrecy is permissible): To him who does this seeking the good pleasure of Allah We shall soon give a reward of the highest (value),Alheri ndondo dan mini kundondo yan ezaba swiswociazhi boa sai de yan za na gae jin foro be sadaka jin'y na ko jin jin yan alheri na ko ma gyara jin tsakani zawangizhio na.

Surah 4:115 ,                  If anyone contends with the Messenger even after guidance has been plainly conveyed to him and follows a path other than that becoming to men of Faith We shall leave him in the path he has chosen and land him in Hell- what an evil refuge!,Zaeni ndondo na ga'ce leba Tuci (Soko) na baci na bawu'a tula ya wyun'a ni na uci da 'mi tu eko ndoci na jin yan Muminizhia'na Yi ga'u ya dan yan-na wyuntso tsa gan wyun'a dan be yin nae Yi ci ga'u la'dan ena Jahannamao.

Surah 4:117 ,         (The Pagans) leaving Him call but upon female deities: They call but upon satan the persistent rebel!,Yanna de za wuncinzhi e'jin bauta ya na agayi kuti yiwozhio amae yi yandondo yea sai de sheitan na yi eti kagboci na.
Surah 4:118,       Allah did curse him but he said: "I will take of Thy servants a portion Marked off,Soko ma'u bo 'mi. Uci gan akika miga jama'a mini wuzhi wyozhio na ekundoa yi bibaci na la'adin dan egbin'o. 
Surah 4:119,                    "I will mislead them and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle and to deface the (fair) nature created by Allah." Whoever forsaking Allah takes satan for a friend hath of a surety suffered a loss that is manifest,Akika ma miga'agbin mima ga guri kwarwa ladan'a yangban'azhio mi ma'ajin'a foro gan a la tukpa dab azhia ko'a ya (dabba nazhie la wo kutizhi na) akika mia jin'a foro ebo ala alitta Sokoa zhegba. Akika zandondo na ga sheitan la eya maci ke Soko lugwa na akika wyun'ajin hasara hasara na ma'atula na.
Surah 4:120,      Satan makes them promises and creates in them false desires; but satan´s promises are nothing but deception,Wyun'e jin'a alkawali Umae la guri kwarwazhi dan'a umade alkawali ndondo bea yin'a sai de eta.
Surah 4:121,      They (his dupes) will have their dwelling in Hell and from it they will find no way of escape,Za wuncinzhiezhe keba'a gayi Jahannamao ama'ade yandoci na'agan'agwa ke'u lugwa na'a.
Surah 4:122,                   But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness- we shall soon admit them to gardens with rivers flowing beneath-to dwell therein for ever. Allah´s promise is the truth and whose word can be truer than Allah´s, Za nazhi ma imani jin na acie lo 'tun wangizhi na Yi ga'la gandan Aljannazhio nazhi nuwan eduzhi'eje fi takoabo na ama'afi bo fi tutunyin wuncin ma alkawali Soko uyio na yi gaskiya na. Ziy ma fe eza gaskiya eba egan'o a gan Soko.
Surah 4:123 ,                  Not your desires nor those of the People of the Book (can prevail): whoever works evil will be requited accordingly. Nor will he find besides Allah any protector or helper,Ujin guri yezhi ko guri yan za ba Litafizhi tsa'ala tua zandondo na ga lo 'tun dede na a gaugba be'uyin ama'ade zandoci zuma Soko na'afe Ndakata yau na'a uma'ade za na'ajin'u taimako na'a.
Surah 4:124 ,              If any do deeds of righteousness- be they male or female - and have faith they will enter Heaven and not the least injustice will be done to them,Zaeni ndondo na ga lo 'tun wangi wangizhi na dagan mini bagio ko yinzagio alali ma uyi Mumini na to za wuncinzhi gaa gadan Aljannao ama'ajin'a zwaluncia konbe gwargwado yan kpara donbina'a.
Surah 4:125 ,               Who can be better in religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah does good and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith For Allah did take Abraham for a friend,Zi-ma adini jin'u ga gyegan yan za na'a fuska'u (yandondou) baenio la'aya Soko nao umayi za nae jin bolobolo na uma kezhea emi la tu ekpa yan Ibrahima na'a pan baenio zhin eko gaskiya nao Soko ma'a Ibrahima la ezamanci.
Surah 4:126 ,          But to Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth: And He it is that Encompasseth all things,Soko ga ma wun mulki yannazhi fi samazhio to nazhi fi kinbo nao Soko ma'afe Etsu na'a yandondo makezhe na.
Surah 4:127,                                       They ask thy instruction concerning the women say: Allah doth instruct you about them: And (remember) what hath been rehearsed unto you in the Book concerning the orphans of women to whom ye give not the portions prescribed and yet whom ye desire to marry as also concerning the children who are weak and oppressed: that ye stand firm for justice to orphans. There is not a good deed which ye do but Allah is well-acquainted therewith,A mae gbin wyo gan eti hukunci yinzagizhio. Gan gan: Soko'otsoa kpe eganzhi ye ya ye eti hukunci yinzagizhio to nazhi mae gba ya ye dagan mini Litafio eti ekungi yinzagizhio na nazhi ye la'ala egun'azhi ya'a ye mae de shahawa yan yawojin bea yin na.

Surah 4:128,                            If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband´s part there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves; and such settlement is best; even though men´s souls are swayed by greed. But if ye do good and practise self-restraint Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Yinzagi gabea fe gan wyun'e sundan yan eyewu ko zuma zheta dagan eba eba'ubo le'fi danboa na a wa gyara tsakaniabo be dozhi naa uga de alheri gan'o.

Surah 4:129 ,                    Ye are never able to be fair and just as between women even if it is your ardent desire: But turn not away (from a woman) altogether so as to leave her (as it were) hanging (in the air). If ye come to a friendly understanding and practise self-restraint Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Ye ma'jin adalinci wo tsakani yinzagizhi boa (eba cin cin yan yangban'o) ka ye ga bavun yan jin jin acin. Ebo acin'o yega'a pan pinpan yan baeni ke ndoci lugwa ma ye cia la wyun'e lugwa ke yan na ala ban ebao na. (a ya wyun'a ama la'jin anfania).

Surah 4:130 ,         But if they disagree (and must part) Allah will provide abundance for all from His all-reaching bounty: for Allah is He that careth for all and is Wise,A ma ga bea gan be dozhiy Soko ajin bagwo ya zaeni ndondo miniabo dagan mini bagwo arzikiubo. Soko ma Etsu bagwo uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 4:131,                               To Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth. Verily we have directed the People of the Book before you and you (o Muslims) to fear Allah. But if ye deny Him lo! unto Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth and Allah is free of all wants worthy of all praise.Soko ga ma wun mulki yan yannazhi fi samazhio nao to nazhi fi kinbo nao.

Surah 4:132,         Yea unto Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth and enough is Allah to carry through all affairs,Soko ga ma wun mulki yan yannazhi fi samao nao to nazhi fi kinbo na. Soko maakunke na zandondo a yakpe na.
Surah 4:133,           If it were His will He could destroy you o mankind and create another race; for He hath power this to do,Uga ba'U Ugae fin ya baenio ya ye zawangizhi! Ucia be yan'U be za worozhiy. Soko ma Etsu na gboka na uyio eti jinjin acin'o.
Surah 4:134,             If any one desires a reward in this life in Allah´s (gift) is the reward (both) of this life and of the hereafter: for Allah is He that heareth and seeth (all things),Zandondo na gae kpa egagba yan izhe (be etun'yin na) Soko yibe egagba yan izhe to yan ekuy. Soko ma'afe Etsu nae wo yandondo na Etsu nae le yandondo ye na.
Surah 4:135 ,                                   O ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice as witnesses to Allah even as against yourselves or your parents or your kin and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for Allah can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts) lest ye swerve and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice verily Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ye'a fe zanazhia kugikini be adalinci- na ye lae fe eri jincizhi ebo Soko ka wun'ayi eti yetsobo ko ma yanmancizhi ko ma dangi yan tsonbazhi ko eti za na yi eyandeci nao ko ma talaka Soko de gan'a kpata ebo acin'o ega la ;mi tu etun yangban ma kacin'a ye ga pan ke gaskiya lugwa.

Surah 4:136 ,                          O ye who believe! Believe in Allah and His Messenger and the scripture which He hath sent to His Messenger and the scripture which He sent to those before (him). Any who denieth Allah His angels His Books His Messengers and the Day of Judgment hath gone far far astray,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Yea imani jin (wangi) be Sokoe to be Tuci'U yin to be Litafi na ucin be ya Tuci'U na to be Litafi na u cin be shidzona. Zandondo na ga jin kafirinci be Sokoe na to Malaikauzhi to Tuciuzhi to Efo yan zobae na akika za wuncin'a gbin egbin na ma lokpa sarauyin na.
Surah 4:137   ,                Those who believe then reject faith then believe (again) and (again) reject faith and go on increasing in unbelief- Allah will not forgive them nor guide them nor guide them on the way,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci na gancin aci kezhea imani jin aci kezhe jin kafirinci gancin kezhea be ta eti kafirinci jin'o na Soko fe Etsu na'ajin'a gafara na'a U ma'a la'ake eko gurua.
Surah 4:138,     To the Hypocrites give the glad tidings that there is for them (but) a grievous penalty;-La bushara ya munafikizhi kede' akaika azaba na tan sarauyin na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a. (Bushara= labari).
Surah 4:139 ,            Yea to those who take for friends unbelievers rather than believers: is it honour they seek among them Nay- all honour is with Allah,Za nazhie da la kafirizhi eya mancizhi ke Muminizhi lugwa na be ke' e'wa zankpe ndoci wa za dagan gwata'abo na Ngan akika zankpe kpata eba Soko bou dan'o.
Surah 4:140,                                Already has He sent you Word in the Book that when ye hear the signs of Allah held in defiance and ridicule ye are not to sit with them unless they turn to a different theme: if ye did ye would be like them. For Allah will collect the hypocrites and those who defy faith - all in Hell,Akika ma Soko cin be ya ye dan mini Litafio kede' ye gae be wo aya yan Soko zhi acie jin kafirinci bea yin acie la 'mi bea yin ye'ga fedun beayin kanga be ma sai aga bea lo dan eza ndoci najin wuncin'a na.

Surah 4:141,                                   (These are) the ones who wait and watch about you: if ye do gain a victory from Allah they say: "Were we not with you"- but if the unbelievers gain a success they say (to them): "Did we not gain an advantage over you and did we not guard you from the believers" but Allah will judge betwixt you on the Day of Judgment. And never will Allah grant to the unbelievers a way (to triumphs) over the believers,Za nazhie la 'ye tu ye yanna ga'tswan ye na harma nasara ndoci ga'ade ye dagan eba soko agan: Asa ujin be yeyin ga yi dan'a Uma'a yi kafirizhi ga-be de rabo ndocio agan: Asa yi zan ye kpea Yi ma ke' kangwa ya ye be Muminizhi yin'a To Soko ga hukunci jin tsakaniebo be dozhiy Efo Alkiyamiy Soko ma'ala kagbo ya kafirizhi ta eti Muminizhi boa.
Surah 4:142,                  The Hypocrites - they think they are over-reaching Allah but He will over-reach them: When they stand up to prayer they stand without earnestness to be seen of men but little do they hold Allah in remembrance,Akika munafikizhi ajin afe' ta Soko (eba yekpaabo) alali ma Soko ga'a wo gbata be etaazhiy kamina aga' nakin da jin swalla na e'nakin na be nakan gban'e. E'jin jin ebo zawangizhia leye amae pa Sokoa sai de'gi.
Surah 4:143,               (They are) distracted in mind even in the midst of it- being (sincerely) for neither one group nor for another whom Allah leaves straying- never wilt thou find for him the way,Ceka celozhin zhi ayio dan tacin wuncin bo' adan mini zannazhio loloa Ama dan mini zan nazhio loloa.Zandondo na Soko gaU gbin na wyoade eko (guru) ndoci la yau bea.
Surah 4:144 ,               O ye who believe! Take not for friends unbelievers rather than believers: Do ye wish to offer Allah an open proof against yourselves,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la kafirizhi masoyizhi ke Muminizhi lugwa ma. Kashi ye' wawa gan ye'la dalili yan gbangbae lae wu Soko na Uga wan ye na.
Surah 4:145,          The Hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire: no helper wilt thou find for them,Akika munafikizhi afi mini tako yan gushe na gba gan mini enao na. wyo ma'ade taimako jinci ndondo ya'a.
Surah 4:146 ,                Except for those who repent mend (their lives) hold fast to Allah and purify their religion as in Allah´s sight: if so they will be (numbered) with the believers. And soon will Allah grant to the believers a reward of immense value,Sai de za nazhi ga tuba jin acia miniazhi yejin acia 'gwasun bawu Soko acia edzuta la'adan jin jin adinio ebo Soko to  za wuncinzhi dan mini Muminizhio Soko ma'ala egagba na wancin na ya Muminizhi.
Surah 4:147,          What can Allah gain by your punishment if ye are grateful and ye believe Nay it is Allah that recogniseth (all good) and knoweth all things,Ki-yi yan na Soko de dajin (yan anfani) be azaba jin ye yin nao ye ga'fe eza yebojinzhi yeci kezhea imani jin nao Soko ma'afe Etsu yebojin Etsu kpikpe.
Surah 4:148 ,            Allah loveth not that evil should be noised abroad in public speech except where injustice hath been done; for Allah is He who heareth and knoweth all things,Sokoe wa lilatu yan eyan dede mini eganboa sai de za na ga jin'u zwalunci na. Soko ma'afe Etsu nae wo yandondo na Etsu kpikpe.
Surah 4:149 ,            Whether ye publish a good deed or conceal it or cover evil with pardon verily Allah doth blot out (sins) and hath power (in the judgment of values),Ye ga alheri la'tu ko ma yeci'uswo ko ma yeci fa be le'fi egun na'jin ye na (egagba yandondo dan be Sokoe) Akika ma Sokoa fe Etsu nae fa na Etsu na de iko ta eti yandondo na.
Surah 4:151,       They are in truth (equally) unbelievers; and we have prepared for unbelievers a humiliating punishment,Za wuncinzhi ga yi kafirizhi yan haki kao yi ma' shiri jin ya kafirizhi yan azaba yan zunyesun.
Surah 4:152 ,               To those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction between any of the messengers we shall soon give their (due) rewards: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Za nazhi-ma a imani jin be Sokoe ganni be TuciUzhi-na ama la erikpe ndoci dan tsakania boa na za wuncinzhi be le'yin aga egagba'a la'aya Soko ma'afe Etsu gafara Etsu yegun.
Surah 4:153,                                    The people of the Book ask thee to cause a book to descend to them from heaven: Indeed they asked Moses for an even greater (miracle) for they said: "Show us Allah in public" but they were dazed for their presumption with thunder and lightning. Yet they worshipped the calf even after clear signs had come to them; even so we forgave them; and gave Moses manifest proofs of authority,Jama'a nazhi'ala Litafi ya na e'gbin wyo gan gan wyo'ocin Litafi ndocio ya'a dagan samao. Akika agbin Musa gan yan yan na gbota gan acin na leani aci gan: "La Soko wu yi gbangbae yi- le'u ye'. Kabara yan sanma cia wan ebo zwalunci na'ajin na gancin acia nanko gigi la cie jin bauta ya baci na hujjazhi nazhia tula dabe ya'a ni na. yicia fa be wuncin'y Yicia dalili na'atula na la'ya Musa.Surah 4:154                  And for their covenant we raised over them (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai); and (on another occasion) we said: "Enter the gate with humility"; and (once again) we commanded them: "Transgress not in the matter of the sabbath." And we took from them a solemn covenant.Yicia pati yan Turu la'aketo ta fitiabo ebo alkawaliabo yi ma gan ya'gan: "Yea gandan eko be ekpyade" Yi ci ke gan 'a gan; "Ega kara gwo iyaka gan dan Asibio ma" Yi ma gwo alkawali na lekpan na dagan eba'abo.
Surah 4:155 ,                    (They have incurred divine displeasure): In that they broke their covenant; that they rejected the signs of Allah; that they slew the Messengers in defiance of right; that they said "Our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve Allah´s Word; We need no more)";- Nay Allah hath set the seal on their hearts for their blasphemy and little is it they believe,Ebo luloya yan alkawaliazhi be kafirincia yin be aya Soko zhi be wuwu Annabizhi na jin eti hakki ndondo boa na be egan nazhie dagan gan; "Yangban'azhi' a yaba (wun'atsu) A'a Soko dea yangban'azhi te-ebo kafirinci naejin nao. Ebo acin'o ajin imani'a sai de'gi.
Surah 4:156,    That they rejected Faith; that they uttered against Mary a grave false charge,To ebo kafirincio to egan na'agan eti Maryamuo na yi ganmana tswitswaci gbonta na.
Surah 4:157,                                 That they said (in boast) "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary the Messenger of Allah";- but they killed him not nor crucified him but so it was made to appear to them and those who differ therein are full of doubts with no (certain) knowledge but only conjecture to follow for of a surety they killed him not,To gingan na'agan gan: "Yi yia Isa egi Maryamu na yi Tuci Soko na wu" alali ma a wu wyun'a ama fo'u sa' amma'a a eza la'abeu fia. Akika ma za nazhi- ce dozhi leba eti alamariubo na e'jin kelokezhin dan miniubo ade hakika yan kpikpe etiuboa sai de yekpa nae la 'mi tu na a ma wu'u eba hakika boa.
Surah 4:158,       Nay Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power Wise,A' a Soko'Ula da fiti lo eba wyuntso Soko ma'afe Etsu kpikpe Etsu hikima.
Surah 4:159             And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment he will be a witness against them,Ama de zandondo dan mini za ba Litafi zhi boa sai na wyun'a gaskiya ya be uyin shidzo be'dzo ka fi'ujin ajali na Efo Alkiyami'ima uga'afe eri ta etiabo.
Surah 4:160             For the iniquity of the Jews We made unlawful for them certain (foods) good and wholesome which had been lawful for them;- in that they hindered many from Allah´s Way,To ebo zwalunci na fe be gwata Yahuduzhio na Yi yia yangici managi managizhi la'ajin haramu ya'a nazhi-ma halali ayi ya'ao na to ebo kinkan kanma nae kan zawangizhi ezanda ta eti eko Soko na.
Surah 4:161 ,            That they took usury though they were forbidden; and that they devoured men´s substance wrongfully;- we have prepared for those among them who reject faith a grievous punishment,To ewo yan riba(ewo nuwan) nae gwo na alali ma'a kan jin jin wuncin leani to ewo zazhi nae giayan eti ganmanao na. Yi ma shiri jin ya kafirizhi miniabo yan azaba nayi tintanci na.
Surah 4:162 ,                       But those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge and the believers believe in what hath been revealed to thee and what was revealed before thee: And (especially) those who establish regular prayer and practise regular charity and believe in Allah and in the Last Day: To them shall We soon give a great reward,Amma'ade za nazhia shidu dan kpikpeo miniabo na to Muminizhi a imani jin be yanna acin be shi wyo dzo nae. To zanazhi mae ku swalla gikini na to za nazhie wa zakka na to zanzhia imani jin be Sokoe to Efo zobae na za wuncinzhi kpata yia la egagba na wancin na ya'a.
Surah 4:163,                        We have sent thee inspiration as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham Isma´il Isaac Jacob and the Tribes to Jesus Job Jonah Aaron and solomon and to David We gave the Psalms,Akika  yi jin wahyi be ya wyoe dozhin kendoe Yi jin wahyi be ya Nuhu na to Annabizhi nazhi be zumaubona. Yima ke'jin wahyi ya Ibrahima to Isma'ila to Ishaqa to Yakuba to yagizhi to Isa to Ayuba to Yunusa to Haruna to Sulaimanu Yima la Litafi zabura ya Dawuda.
Surah 4:164,             Of some messengers We have already told thee the story; of others We have not;- and to Moses Allah spoke direct,To Tuci ndocizhi danbo Yia labariazhi la ya wyoe le'ani Tuci ndocizhi ma danbo Yi la labariazhi ya wyo ya'a Soko ma gangan be Musae egan yan hakika.
Surah 4:165,              Messengers who gave good news as well as warning that mankind after (the coming) of the messengers should have no plea against Allah: For Allah is Exalted in Power Wise,Tucizhi ayio e'ya labari yangban fazhi a mayi za nazhie na wun na ebo zawangizhi'a gade hujjandondo ta eti Soko-ma baci na wyun'a Tucizhi tuntun'ani na. Soko ma'afe Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima.
Surah 4:166  ,          But Allah beareth witness that what He hath sent unto thee He hath sent from His (own) knowledge and the angels bear witness: But enough is Allah for a witness,Amma'ade Soko'otso ejin 'ri be yanna Ucin ya wyo na Ucin'ucin be kpikpe Uyin Malaikazhio tsoejin ri Soko'otso ma'kun Eri.
Surah 4:167,          Those who reject Faith and keep off (men) from the way of Allah have verily strayed far far away from the Path,Akika zanazhi'ajin kafirinci na aci kan zawangizhi 'zan ta eti eko Soko na akika zawuncinzhi'a gbin egbin na ma' kpeya na.
Surah 4:168,           Those who reject Faith and do wrong- Allah will not forgive them nor guide them to any way,Akika za nazhi-jin kafirinci na a ma jin zwalunci na Ufe yanna gwoyin ya Soko na wyun'a jin'a gafara na'a Uma gwoyin na wyun'a wuaba ta eko gboro na'a.
Surah 4:169 ,         Except the way of Hell to dwell therein for ever. And this to Allah is easy,Sai de eko yan Jahannama baga bo ma'afi tutun yin'o. wuncin ma eyan fifanci uyi ya Soko.
Surah 4:170 ,                     O Mankind! The Messenger hath come to you in truth from Allah: believe in him: It is best for you. But if ye reject Faith to Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth: And Allah is All-knowing All-wise,Ya ye zawangizhi! Akika Tuci (Soko) dabe yaye be gaskiyae dagan eba Tsoci yebo ebo acin'o yea imani jin wuncin fe alhe'ri yaye gan. Ye ma gabeajin kafirinci to akika Soko ga wun mulki yannazhi fi sanmazhio to kin bo nao. Soko ma'afe Etsu kpikpe Etsu hikima
Surah 4:171,                                                    O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of Allah aught but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) a messenger of Allah and His Word which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit proceeding from Him: so believe in Allah and His messengers. Say not "Trinity" : desist: it will be better for you: for Allah is one Allah: Glory be to Him: (far exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs,Ya ye za ba Litafizhi! Ega gwo iyaka gan dan mini adiniebo ma ye mae ga gangan ndondo ta Soko ma sai de nagayi gaskiya na. Akika Masihu Isa egi Maryama Tuci Soko uyio umayi egan'u nae wugwa zankpeUna Na'U la ya Maryama na umayi Ruhi dagan eba ubo.

Surah 4:172 ,                Christ disdaineth nor to serve and worship Allah nor do the angels those nearest (to Allah): those who disdain His worship and are arrogant-He will gather them all together unto Himself to (answer),Masihu (Isa) u sungwo lea na uga'afe wuzhi ya Soko na'a acinga ga Malaikazhi nazhi yi za tsonbazhi nao. Zandondo na gae sungwo yan bauta na wyun'ajin ya Soko na ucie la 'ti danfin'o na to akika Soko ga'aku yekan baenio zhin ebaU.
Surah 4:173  ,                       But to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness He will give their (due) rewards- and more out of His bounty: But those who are disdainful and arrogant He will punish with a grievous penalty; Nor will they find besides Allah any to protect or help them,Ammade zanazhia imani jin a ci lotun wangizhina Soko ga laadazhi shekpan ya'a uma'abea dagan mini falalauzhio zanazhima gae la gwosun wu (imani na) a cie gbotika na to Sokoa jin'a azaba na tan na ama'ade zunma Soko Ndakata ndoci ko taimako jinci ndocia.Surah 4:174          O mankind! verily there hath come to you a convincing proof from your Lord: For We have sent unto you a light (that is) manifest.Ya ye zawangizhi! Hakika hujjako dabe yaye dagan eba Tsoci yebo'ani (ugayi Annabi Muhammaduo) yi ma cin haske na'atula na be yaye (ugayi Al-kuranuo).Surah 4:175              Then those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him- soon will He admit them to mercy and grace from Himself and guide them to Himself by a straight way.Ammaade za nazhia imani jin na acia egwa sun'u gbanyin na bele'yin Soko ga'ala dan mini yegun'o dagan nko wyuntso ganni be falalae uma'a wuaba zhin ebaU ta ekpa natso yi gboro na.Surah 4:176                                                 They ask thee for a legal decision. Say: Allah directs (thus) about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs. If it is a man that dies leaving a sister but no child she shall have half the inheritance: If (such a deceased was) a woman who left no child Her brother takes her inheritance: If there are two sisters they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance (between them): if there are brothers and sisters (they share) the male having twice the share of the female. Thus doth Allah make clear to you (His law) lest ye err. And Allah hath knowledge of all things.Egbin wyo gan kpikpe.
