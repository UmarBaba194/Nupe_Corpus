Surah 28:1 ,Ta. Sin. Mim.,TA SIN MIM
Surah 28:2,   These are Verses of the Book that makes (things) clear.,Wuncinzhi ayazhi ayio yan Litafi na yi gbangba na.
Surah 28:3 ,       We rehearse to thee some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in Truth for people who believe.,Yie gba ya wyoe dagan mini labari Musa be Fir'aunae be gaskiyae ebo (ualufe bibe imani'uya) muminizhi.
Surah 28:4  ,Truly Pharaoh elated himself in the land and broke up its people into sections depressing a small group among them: their sons he slew but he kept alive their females: for he was indeed a maker of mischief.,Akika Fir'auna'a gbintu ta eti kinbo ucia jamaazhi safi kpere-kpere ucie yibaba zandocizhi miniabo ufe zun egi bagiazhi ucie la egi yinzagizhi lugwa. Akika wyun'afe dan mini zanazhie nyin-yan nae.
Surah 28:5,           And We wished to be Gracious to those who were being depressed in the land to make them leaders (in Faith) and make them heirs,Yimaa kpa gan Yia twarya ya zanazhi e yiba baa dan kinbo na Yima-y-la'ae la-y-fe dzoshicizhi Yi ma-y-la'ae la'y-fe egungicizhi. (yan mulki na Fir'aunae jin na).
Surah 28:6,To establish a firm place for them in the land and to show Pharaoh Haman and their hosts at their hands the very things against which they were taking precautions,Yima ga'aya kagbo dan kinbo Yi ma gaa la wu Fir'auna to Hamana to ekunguciazhi zagu baaba iri yannazhi agae sundan beayin na.
Surah 28:7 ,So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses: "Suckle (thy child) but when thou hast fears about him cast him into the river but fear not nor grieve: for We shall restore him to thee and We shall make him one of Our messengers.",Yima ci jin wahyi ya Nna yan Musa gan: "U'u ya be ye kamina wyo gae be sundan yau na to u'u ce ta eduo wyo mao ga sundan ma wyo mao ga nyin yangban ma akika Yi gau lazhin bea ya wyoe Yi ma ga'u laafe dan mini Tucizhio.
Surah 28:8 ,Then the people of Pharaoh picked him up (from the river): (It was intended) that (Moses) should be to them an adversary and a cause of sorrow: for Pharaoh and Haman and (all) their hosts were men of sin.,Za mi Fir'auna zhi ci'u de la ebo (zunma-- ) ubea zhe makiri be yangban nyin'y yaa ma. Akika Fir'auna to Hamana to ekungunciazhi aafe bicicincizhi.
Surah 28:9    ,             The wife of Pharaoh said: "(Here is) joy of the eye for me and for thee: slay him not. It may be that he will be use to us or we may adopt him as a son." And they perceived not (what they were doing)!,Yinmi Fir'auna ci gan: "Egi nna yangban tacin uyio ya mi to wyoe ye mae ga wu'u ma kengi'i uyio na wyun'a jin yi anfani na ko ma yi'i la wyun'ila egi" Ama kpe yanna Sokoa jin yan'u naa.
Surah 28:10  ,              But there came to be a void in the heart of the mother of Moses: She was going almost to disclose his (case) had We not strengthened her heart (with faith) so that she might remain a (firm) believer.,Yangban yan Nna yan Musa cia fe foko-yin (yandondo fibo sai yekpa eti Musao) De gi keo kacan'a ugaa yanna dan beuyin na tula kagan ujin ebo yangban wu na Yi la dan'u yangban'o naa ebo ma ulaufeo dan mini muminizhio.
Surah 28:11 ,        And she said to the sister of (Moses) "Follow him" so she (the sister) watched him in the character of a stranger. And they knew not.,Ucia gan ya yegiu yinzagi gan: "A mitu ekpau" Uci taye leuye dagan ba kpaako ama kpegan (yegiu uyia).
Surah 28:12           ,    And we ordained that he refused suck at first until (His sister came up and) said: "Shall I point out to you the people of a house that will nourish and bring him up for you and be sincerely attached to him"...,Tun shidzo batsozhio ma Yia ebe nuwan yan yinzagi nazhie yaabe ye na laajin haramu yau (yegiu) ci gan: Ngba min wuyeba lo zaba emi ndocizhi nazhia yau be ye amaajin bolobolo beuyin na
Surah 28:13 ,               Thus did We restore him to his mother that her eye might be comforted that she might not grieve and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true: but most of them do not understand.Yiciu la dazhin eba Nna'u be ebo yangban wyun'u cin'u ta umau ga nyin yangban ma umau kpe'u wo ke akika alkawali Soko gaskiya uyio-na amaade ekundondoazhi a kpea.
Surah 28:14   ,      When he reached full age and was firmly established (in life) We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge: for thus do We reward those who do good.,Kamina ubea jin baligi na ucia gun za na Yi twaurya be hukunci ganni be ilimiy (kpikpe) acinga gama Yie la egagba ya zanazhi gae jin bolobolo nao
Surah 28:15 ,                                    And he entered the city at a time when its people were not watching: and he found there two men fighting- one of his own religion and the other of his foes. Now the man of his own religion appealed to him against his foe and Moses struck him with his fist and made an end of him. He said: "This is a work of Evil (Satan): for he is an enemy that manifestly misleads!",Uci daa gandan zhinin bo kanga ma zawangizhi kpea uci da tsun eza bagi guba ndocizhi nazhie sun-wun na; zaeni dagan mini kabilau bo udan'o zabaci nana ma mini nazhie sunwun beuyin na bo udan'o.

Surah 28:16    ,        He prayed: "O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul! Do Thou then forgive me!" So (Allah) forgave him: for He is the Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Ugan: "Tsoci mi! Akika mia eti tacin mi jin zwalunci wyode fa be mi yin" Soko ma ci fa beuyin; akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun Uyio.
Surah 28:17  ,      He said: "O my Lord! For that Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace on me never shall I be a help to those who sin!",Ugan: "Tsoci mi! Be iri ni'ima nazhi wyola ya mi nae mia fe zanaejin lefi jincizhi taimako naa.
Surah 28:18    ,           So he saw the morning in the city looking about in a state of fear when behold the man who had the day before sought his help called aloud for his help (again). Moses said to him: "Thou art truly it is clear a quarrelsome fellow!",Ucia tinba gun zhininbo ufe sundan yangban mae yan-yan (ko kia be jin'o) gancin nda na wa taimako beuyin tsuwo na wyun'e ke ye'uyi be Musa cia gan'u gan: "Wyode eza egbin wyo yio naa tula na.
Surah 28:19     ,                          Then when he decided to lay hold of the man who was an enemy to both of them that man said: "O Moses! Is it thy intention to slay me as thou slewest a man yesterday Thy intention is none other than to become a powerful violent man in the land and not to be one who sets things right!",To kamina Musa kpagan wyun'asun natso yi makiri na egwao na (natsoe wa taimako na) ci gan: "Wyoe Musa!

Surah 28:20        ,         And there came a man running from the furthest end of the City. He said: "O Moses! the Chiefs are taking counsel together about thee to slay thee: so get thee away for I do give thee sincere advice.",Eza bagi ndoci (mumini mini jamaa yan Fir'auna zhio) cia tinya dagan ba kpaako yan zhi ninbo ucife dinye uci gan: "Wyoe Musa!

Surah 28:21     ,    He therefore got away therefrom looking about in a state of fear. He prayed "O my Lord! save me from people given to wrong-doing.",Ucia tinya dagan miniubo be dasun'y ucie cin bazhi le elo be zhin'y ugan: "Tsoci mi! Wa mi dzun dagan egun jamaa yan azwalumizhio.
Surah 28:22 ,         Then when he turned his face towards (the land of) Madyan he said: "I do hope that my Lord will show me the smooth and straight Path.",Kamina ula'ye wu kansanta yan Madyana na ugan: "Mie jin kauna gan Tsoci mi wyun'a wu mi ba lo eko natso yi daidai na.
Surah 28:23      ,                    And when he arrived at the watering (place) in Madyan he found there a group of men watering (their flocks) and besides them he found two women who were keeping back (their flocks). He said: "What is the matter with you" They said: "We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take back (their flocks): And our father is a very old man.",Kamina ufe kpan lo eba nuwan (-- ga) Madyana na uci da tsun jamaa zhi dokun zhi bagao (e ya dabbazhi nuwan fin) uci ke tsun yinzagi guba ndocizhi kansantaabo e yan dabba zhi uci gan'agan: "Ki'i jin ye yio" A cigan yia ya dabba yizhi nuwan fin'a sai de dabba kpaci nanazhi gaa sajin be dzo Baba yi ma wyun'a kuku sarauyin.
Surah 28:24      ,        So he watered (their flocks) for them; then he turned back to the shade and said:"O my Lord! truly am I in (desperate) need of any good that Thou dost send me!",Ucia dabbazhi ya nuwan fin yaa ucia zheban daa wuru ndoci uci gan: "Tsoci mi!

Surah 28:25       ,                  Afterwards one of the (damsels) came (back) to him walking bashfully. She said: "My father invites thee that he may reward thee for having watered (our flocks) for us." So when he came to him and narrated the story he said: "Fear thou not: (well) hast thou escaped from unjust people.",Zaeni mini yinzagi guba wuncinzhio ci da be ebau uci fe dazan be zunye ucigan: "Akika Baba mie yi wyoe ebo ula egagba nuwan na wyo ya dabba yizhi fin na'uya wyoe".

Surah 28:26      ,   Said one of the (damsels): "O my (dear) father! engage him on wages: truly the best of men for thee to employ is the (man) who is strong and trusty"....,Zaeni mini egi yinzagi wuncinzhio ci gan: "Baba u'ula egi tun'y akika ade zana -- yin gan na wyoa la tun naa sai zana gboka uma yi eza amaana na.
Surah 28:27 ,                           He said: "I intend to wed one of these my daughters to thee on condition that thou serve me for eight years; but if thou complete ten years it will be (grace) from thee. But I intend not to place thee under a difficulty: thou wilt find me indeed if Allah wills one of the righteous.",Ucia gan ya (Musa) gan: "Mie kpa gan min jin yawo'n ya wyoe be egi mi nini mini zagubaaba nazhi zhi daa na eti etun na wyoa lo ya mi yan eya gutota na gancin wyo ga beu gun eya guwo to wuncin yi etsa yan ti tacin wyotso; mi ma kpa gan mi'nla bayiba ndoci'n ta wyo yaa wyo maa tsun mi ugaa ba Soko na mini za guruzhio (nazhie she alkawali na).
Surah 28:28    ,          He said: "Be that (the agreement) between me and thee: whichever of the two terms I fulfil let there be no ill-will to me. Be Allah a witness to what we say.",(Musa) ci gan: "Wuncin de yi tsakani mi bo be wyo yin mini eka gubaabao ndondo na miga be jin na gbin gbintu ndoci ta eti mi boa Soko gama yi eri tsakani yibo eti yannazhi yie gan nao.
Surah 28:29 ,                         Now when Moses had fulfilled the term and was travelling with his family he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tur. He said to his family: "Tarry ye; I perceive a fire; I hope to bring you from there some information or a burning firebrand that ye may warm yourselves.",To kamina Musa bea etun lozo dan lokaci bibacio na wyun'a tinya dan zan'o be iyaliu yin uci taye le ena ye kansanta pati yan TUURIO uci gan ya iyaaliu gan: "Yea fedun zhiabo akika mi taye le ena ye (ebo acin'o mia tun bo) ujin wo ko mia be yaye be labari'i ko ma be ena cikara na yea de ye na.
Surah 28:30   ,               But when he came to the (fire) a voice was heard from the right bank of the valley from a tree in hallowed ground: "O Moses! Verily I am Allah the Lord of the Worlds....,Kamina u tun bau na aci yiu dagan egwa gwaalo yan kpankoro dan danna albarka yan cigban wuncin'o; "Wyoe Musa!

Surah 28:31  ,                "Now do thou throw thy rod!" but when he saw it moving (of its own accord) as if it had been a snake he turned back in retreat and retraced not his steps: O Moses!" (It was said) "Draw near and fear not: for thou art of those who are secure.,Wyo mao la tsukun wyo yo'o cici kamina ule'u ye cie kun ke ewa na wyun'a zunma zheta ci fe bici uma zheye ban'a.

Those are the two credentials from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: for truly they are a people rebellious and wicked.",Wyo mao la egwa wyo yo'o lao dan koro-ewo wyobo ugaa tinya bokun'y na ma de egun ndondoa na wyo mao la egwa'o laoba kansan wyobo ebo dansun (bokun bo'ubo).

Surah 28:34   ,          "And my brother Aaron - He is more eloquent in speech than I: so send him with me as a helper to confirm (and strengthen) me: for I fear that they may accuse me of falsehood.",Yegi mi Haruna ma ude fasaha gintara gan mi ebo acin'o U'u tun-tun ganni be mi yin ebo'u jin mi taimako uma'u ya mi gaskiya akika mie sundan gan aa bea egan mi yi ganmana.

Surah 28:43 ,              We did reveal to Moses the Book after We had destroyed the earlier generations (to give) Insight to men and guidance and Mercy that they might receive admonition.,Akika Yila litafi (Ataura) ya Musa baci na Yia alumma yan mafarizhi jin hallaka na.

Surah 28:45   ,              But We raised up (new) generations and long were the ages that passed over them; but thou wast not a dweller among the people of Madyan rehearsing Our Signs to them; but it is We Who send messengers (with inspiration).,Amaade Yi jin alitaa alummazhi (dokun) ekundo eya izhe cia lokpa fia wyo ma fedun dan tacin za Madyanazhio ci fe gba aya Yizhi ya aa amade Yide e tun wyo tun fia.
Surah 28:46      ,             Nor wast thou at the side of (the Mountain of) Tur when we called (to Moses).

Surah 28:47,                 If (We had) not (sent thee to the Quraish)- in case a calamity should seize them for (the deeds) that their hands have sent forth they might say: "Our Lord! why didst Thou not sent us a messenger We should then have followed Thy Signs and been amongst those who believe!",Kagan umajin ebo masi'iba ndoci be dea maa be iri etun nazhi egwaatsozhi la shidzo naa har ma atsoa fe be gangan:"Ki'ila wyoci tun Tuci fi yi yia yin'o ngan daa yi ga emi tu aya wyozhi yi ma gaafe dan mini mumini zhio.

Surah 28:53    ,          And when it is recited to them they say: "We believe therein for it is the Truth from our Lord: indeed we have been Muslims (bowing to Allah´s Will) from before this.,Ama ga gba kaatun yaa aajin agan gan: "Yia imani jin beu yin akika gaskiya uyio dagan eba Tsoci yi bo akika ma yiafe musulumizhi shidzo be dzo.

Surah 28:57   ,                     They say: "If we were to follow the guidance with thee we should be snatched away from our land." Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary to which are brought as tribute fruits of all kinds- a provision from Ourselves but most of them understand not.,Aci gan: "Yiga mitu bawu (nana) be wyo yin aga yi fela dagan kin yan yibo (Gan yaa gan): Asa ujin yi ga la Harami shishi yaye be aminci nama e ku yangici sun-sunzhi iri ndondo bebo naa Ngan wuncin arziki uyio dagan eba Yibo.

Surah 28:59   ,                Nor was thy Lord the one to destroy a population until He had sent to its centre a messenger rehearsing to them Our Signs; nor are We going to destroy a population except when its members practise iniquity.,Tsoci wyo mae jin alkarya hallaka'a sai Uga Tuci tun fi ezhi koazhio naafe gba aya Yizhi yaa na.

Surah 28:60    ,          The (material) things which ye are given are but the conveniences of this life and the glitter thereof; but that which is with Allah is better and more enduring: will ye not then be wise,Yandondo nama aga la yaye na to eyan eman-wo izhe uyi be ninpau yin'o.

Surah 28:61     ,           Are (these two) alike- one to whom We have made a goodly promise and who is going to reach its (fulfilment) and one to whom We have given the good things of this life but who on the Day of Judgment is to be among those brought up (for punishment),Ngba zana Yi jin'u alkawali wangi na nama wyun'a be gun be yin na ugaazhe ye ni be zana ema izhe kawan yin Yi la yau cie wo-ona gancin ma Efo Alkiyami'i aa kua ku dafi enao na
Surah 28:62,       That Day (Allah) will call to them and say "Where are my ´partners´- whom ye imagined (to be such)",(Wyo mao pa) Efo na Soko gaa yia na Ucia gangan: Babo kuti nazhi yefe la pa Mi baci izheo na dan'o
Surah 28:63   ,              Those against whom the charge will be proved will say: "Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray: we led them astray as we were astray ourselves: we free ourselves (from them) in Thy presence: it was not us they worshipped.",Zanazhi ma azaba Sokoajin tabbata ta etiabo na gan: "Tsoci yi!

Surah 28:64  ,          It will be said (to them): "Call upon your ´partners´ (for help)" :they will call upon them but they will not listen to them; and they will see the Penalty (before them); (how they will wish) ´if only they had been open to guidance!´,Acigan: "E yi kuti yezhi be" gancin aci yia ama zhea gan'a. Acia azaba leye. (Aci fe jin guri gan) e gan gan yeafe eza bawuzhia!

Surah 28:66    ,  Then the (whole) story that Day will seem obscure to them (like light to the blind) and they will not be able (even) to question each other.,Labari kpaata cia gbin'a eyeo fo wuncin atso ma gbin dozhi gan woa.
Surah 28:67  ,        But any that (in this life) had repented believed and worked righteousness will have hopes to be among those who achieve salvation.,To amaade za na ga tuba jin ucia imani jin uci lotun wangi na to kengi uyio na ugaafe dan mini eza robo zhio na.
Surah 28:68   ,          Thy Lord does create and choose as He pleases: no choice have they (in the matter): Glory to Allah! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)!,Tsoci wyo maa jin ujin alitta yanna ga baUna Umae tsa yanna ga baUna ujin aa tsa wun etsa'a.

Surah 28:73 ,           It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you Night and Day- that ye may rest therein and that ye may seek of his Grace;- and in order that ye may be grateful.,Udan mini yegun'Ubo na wyun'a yeshi to batin jin yaye ebo ye shi yangban tae danbo (yeshii) ye mae wa arzikieza bo (yigidii) na ujin wo be wuncin'y ye gaafe zanazhie jin yebo na.

Surah 28:75    ,            And from each people shall We draw a witness and We shall say: "Produce your Proof": then shall they know that the Truth is in Allah (alone) and the (lies) which they invented will leave them in lurch.,Yiciga eri ndoci wa-ka dagan mini alumma ndondo (agayi Annabiazhio) Yicia gangan: "Ela hujja yezhi be (na la yeci layan pa Mi baci na) atso ci gaa kpe kede gaskiya be Soko-yin-udan'o na yannazhi'i ma afe tswa kpaata na ci gaa gbin'a yeo.
Surah 28:76    ,                        Qarun was doubtless of the people of Moses; but he acted insolently towards them: such were the treasures We had bestowed on him that their very keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men behold his people said to him: "Exult not for Allah loveth not those who exult (in riches).,Akika Karuna udan mini jamaa yan Musa zhio ucia gbin tu be ayin Yi ma twa'urya be edzunba yan arzikizhi'i na ma giyekoazhi kara bididiayio ya jamaa nazhi yi kagbocizhi na.

Surah 28:77     ,                    "But seek with the (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on thee the Home of the Hereafter nor forget thy portion in this world: but do thou good as Allah has been good to thee and seek not (occasions for) mischief in the land: for Allah loves not those who do mischief.",Wyo mao wa emi yan Zoba (wangi) dan mini yannazhi Soko ga la twarya ya wyo na wyo mao ga ba robo wyozhi tan dan mini izheo ma; wyo mao feo jin bolobolo kendoe Soko jin bolobolo ya wyo na.

Surah 28:78  ,                         He said: "This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge which I have." Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him (whole) generations- which were superior to him in strength and greater in the amount (of riches) they had collected but the wicked are not called (immediately) to account for their sins.Ugan: ",Akika ala dukiya la yami eti kpikpe na mide nao" Beke u kpe gan Sokoa alumma nazhi dokun na nazhi shidzo amade kagbo amade dukiya gan'u na wyun'a jin hallakaa naa Amaade (Sokoe) da da gbin lefi jincizhi gan eti etun lefiazhi boa.
Surah 28:79        ,           So he went forth among his people in the (pride of his wordly) glitter. Said those whose aim is the Life of this World: "Oh! that we had the like of what Qarun has got! for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune!",Ucia tinya fi jamaa yan'uzhi dan mini ninpaubo zanazhie wa izhe na cigan: "Kaasa!

Surah 28:82 ,                        And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow: "Ah! it is indeed Allah Who enlarges the provision or restricts it to any of His servants He pleases! had it not been that Allah was gracious to us He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Ah! those who reject Allah will assuredly never prosper.",Gancin zanazhi fe jin kauna kinigibau tsuwo na cia tin ba aci fe gan gan: "Eyan mamaki asa de Soko deajin ula arziki la ya zana gabaU mini wuzhiUzhiona Umae yi'uku be kagan ujin ebo sa'a yan Soko boa daa aga yitso zhekpe.

Surah 28:84    ,             If any does good the reward to him is better than his deed; but if any does evil the doers of evil are only punished (to the extent) of their deeds.,Zaeni ndondo naga be be etun wangi nini'i na wyun'ade egagba na gan acin na; zana ma ga be be etun dede e na to aa la egagba ndoci ya zanazhie lotun dede naa sai de yan iri etun dede na aga lo na.
Surah 28:85        ,          Verily He Who ordained the Qur´an for thee will bring thee back to the Place of Return. Say: "My Lord knows best who it is that brings true guidance and who is in manifest error.",Akika Etsu wuncin nacin Alkuranu ya wyo na uga wyo la da ezhekeba.

Surah 28:86    ,          And thou hadst not expected that the Book would be sent to thee except as a Mercy from thy Lord: Therefore lend not thou support in any way to those who reject (Allah´s Message).,Wyo ma fe zana fe kpaye le gan aa cin Litafi be ya wyo naa sai de yegun na febe dagan eba Tsoci wyobo na.

Surah 28:88      ,            And call not besides Allah on another god. There is no god but He. Everything (that exists) will perish except His own Face. To Him belongs the Command and to Him will ye (all) be brought back.,Wyo mao gajin bauta ya Soko pamba be kuti ndondoe ma ade Tsoci ndoci naa wun naa sai wyin (Soko) yandondo ma gaajin hallaka sai de zaati Soko gbu'ugi wyun ga wun hukunci kpaatao ebaU gabo ma aa la ye zheban lo.
