Surah 20:121   ,           In the result they both ate of the tree and so their nakedness appeared to them: they began to sew together for their covering leaves from the Garden: thus did Adam disobey his Lord and allow himself to be seduced.,Zagubaa ba'a cia gi dagan mini cigban wuncin'o yavun'azhi cia tula zhizhi yaa acife la fini yan Aljanna zhi kan yi taazhi. Adama ma cia le Tsociu ba ucia jin wahala.

Surah 20:127     ,      And thus do We recompense him who transgresses beyond bounds and believes not in the Signs of his Lord: and the Penalty of the Hereafter is far more grievous and more enduring.,Acinga gama Yie la egagba ya zandondo naga rayuwau nyin-ya umajin imani be aya Tsoci u zhi yin'a nao. Azaba yan Alkiyami ma tan gan uma'a danbo gan.
Surah 20:128  ,              Is it not a warning to such men (to call to mind) how many generations before them We destroyed in whose haunts they (now) move Verily in this are Signs for men endued with understanding.,Kashi to gbani ula'a latu ya aa kede Yijin alummazhi dokun nazhi fe dazan fi ezhia zhiona hallaka na'a Hakika mini wuncin'o ayazhi danbo ya zanazhi gayi eza hankali zhi na.

Surah 20:130  ,                 Therefore be patient with what they say and celebrate (constantly) the praises of thy Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting; yea celebrate them for part of the hours of the night and at the sides of the day: that thou mayest have (spiritual) joy.,Ebo acin'o a hakuri jin be iri egan nazhi agae gan na wyo mao feo li Tsoci wyoe be jin jin yeboe yau kafi igidi'u la'u tin'uya na be shidzo kafi igidi'u lo mina to mini yeshio to kansan yan igidio u jin wo Sokoa ga wo be yanna wyoa jin yeda be yin-nae.
Surah 20:131 ,                Nor strain thine eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to parties of them the splendour of the life of this world through which We test them: but the provision of thy Lord is better and more enduring.,Wyo mao ga la eye wyo zhi fe cin yannazhi Yi la ya'a yan eman-wo izhe le na ma ninpa uyio yan izhe kawanyin ebo Yii man'aa cin'y-le dan miniubo.

Surah 20:132  ,         Enjoin prayer on thy people and be constant therein. We ask thee not to provide sustenance: We provide it for thee.

Surah 20:134   ,               And if We had inflicted on them a penalty before this they would have said: "Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent us a messenger we should certainly have followed Thy Signs before we were humbled and put to shame.",Da'aci gan Yi jin'a hallaka jin shidzo be dzo daa a gangan: "Tsoci yi ki la wyoci tun Tuci fi yi yi'a yan'o ngan da yi ga mi tu'u shidzo kaafi yi le egba be zunyesun-y-ye na.
