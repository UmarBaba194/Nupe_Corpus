﻿Surah 10:1 ,    A.L.R. These are the ayats of the Book of Wisdom.,Alif Lam Ra. Wuncinzhi aya yan litafi (Alkuranu) ayio na yi be hikimae na.
Surah 10:2       ,                  Is it a matter of wonderment to men that We have sent Our inspiration to a man from among themselves- that he should warn mankind (of their danger) and give the good news to the Believers that they have before their Lord the lofty rank of truth. (But) say the Unbelievers: "This is indeed an evident sorcerer!",Kashi wun'afe eyan mamaki fe ya zawangizhi na Yi ya'a wahayi jin ya eza bagi miniabo na kede "jin zawangizhi gangba wyo mao ya zanazhia imani jin na labari yangbanfa kede: ade kinigiba wanciko yan dzoshi dan eba Tsociabo na.

Surah 10:3      ,                      Verily your Lord is Allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days and is firmly established on the throne (of authority) regulating and governing all things. No intercessor (can plead with Him) except after His leave (hath been obtained). This is Allah your Lord; Him therefore serve ye: will ye not receive admonition,Hakika Tsoci ye uga yi Soko'o Etsu najin alita sanmazhi to kin dan mini eka yan fo gutsun'ayin'o na gancin ucia jin daidai ta eti Alarashio Ucie jin shiri alamarizhi (kendoe ga ba una).

Surah 10:4   ,                        To Him will be your return- of all of you. The promise of Allah is true and sure. It is He Who beginneth the process of creation and repeateth it that He may reward with justice those who believe and work righteousness; but those who reject Him will have draughts of boiling fluids and a penalty grievous because they did reject Him.,Eba'u gabo ezhe keba ye dan ba'eni bo alkawali Soko ma gaskiya uyio; Hakika Wyun ga yi Etsu nae ca jin jin alitta nao gancin Ucia kezhe u la'azheban zhin Efo Alkiyami ebo u la egagba'u ya zanazhia imani jin aci lo tun wan gi zhi na be adalinci; zanazhi maajin kafirinci na yi be eyan finci na wona sarauyin na be azaba na tan nae ebo kafirinci nazhi afe jin na.
Surah 10:5  ,                    It is He Who made the sun to be a shining glory and the moon to be a light (of beauty) and measured out stages for her; that ye might know the number of years and the count (of time). Nowise did Allah create this but in truth and righteousness. (Thus) doth He explain His Signs in detail for those who understand.,Wyun' ga la igidi cie ban-nao to etswa nae ya haske na ucia jin be ecin ba zhi ebo yede bae de kpikpe yan lisafi (yandondo). Soko jin wuncin zhi jin'a sai de eti gaskiyao. Umae kpe ayazhi ye kpe ya zanazhi ga yi eza kpikpe zhi na.
Surah 10:6       ,      Verily in the alternation of the night and the day and in all that Allah hath created in the heavens and the earth are signs for those who fear Him.,Hakika mini cice le ba yan yeshi to igidi to yannazhi Soko jin fi sanmazhio to kin bo na ayazhi danbo ya jama'a nazhi gae sundan Soko acie tswa'u na.
Surah 10:7    ,          Those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present and those who heed not Our Signs-,Hakika zanazhie sundan yan gun-gun be yi yin'a na acia yeda jin be emawo izhe na yangban'azhi ma'ashi be uyin na to to zanazhia ya ye ke aya Yizhi lugwa na.
Surah 10:8   ,  Their abode is the Fire because of the (evil) they earned.,Za wuncinzhi (kpata) ezhe ke ba'a uga yi enao ebo iri etun (dede) nazhi afe lo na.
Surah 10:9   ,           Those who believe and work righteousness- their Lord will guide them because of their faith: beneath them will flow rivers in gardens of bliss.,Hakika zanazhia imani jin na aci lo tun wangizhi na Tsocia wyun'a bea bawu be imania yin nuwan jijecizhi'afe je fi takoabo fi mini Aljannazhio nazhi yi emi ni'ima na.
Surah 10:10,             (This will be) their cry therein: "Glory to Thee O Allah!" And "Peace" will be their greeting therein! and the close of their cry will be: "Praise be to Allah the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds!",Aduwa na afe ba fi miniubo na "Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya wyoe Soko" emi sa'ama miniubo uga yi "SALAMUO". Aduwa yan zobaama uga yi "yebo kpata'a jin tabbata ya Soko Etsu nae kpa alittazhi kpata na.
Surah 10:11,                 If Allah were to hasten for men the ill (they have earned) as they would fain hasten on the good- then would their respite be settled at once. But We leave those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us in their trespasses wandering in distraction to and fro.,Da aci gan Sokoe din ye din be gwigwo aduwa dede zazhi'i kendoe wyun'e dinye be alheri'i yaana hakika da aga hukunci ba eti ajaliazhi boa ni ebo acin'o Yi ela zanazhie jin kauna yan gun-gun wangi be Yi yin'a na ya fi ragbanzhiazhio aci ga'azhi fi bo.
Surah 10:12    ,                      When trouble toucheth a man He crieth unto Us (in all postures)- lying down on his side or sitting or standing. But when We have solved his trouble he passeth on his way as if he had never cried to Us for a trouble that touched him! thus do the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes!,Kamina egun ga'a to za na wyu'a fe yi Yi ye ci elelebaubo koma edun feubo koma gbaroo.

Surah 10:13  ,              Generations before you We destroyed when they did wrong: their messengers came to them with clear-signs but they would not believe! thus do We requite those who sin!,Hakika Yi jin al'umma nazhi shiyedzo na hallaka lokacina afe jin zwalunci na Tuci'a zhi ma br ya'a be bayanizhi nazhia tu la na amaade ajin imania.

Surah 10:15,                                      But when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed unto them those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us Say: "Bring us a reading other than this or change this" Say: "It is not for me of my own accord to change it: I follow naught but what is revealed unto me: if I were to disobey my Lord I should myself fear the penalty of a Great Day (to come).",Ama gae gba aya Yi nazhia tula na ya'a za nazhie jin kauna gungun wangi be Yi yin'ana ajin agangan: "La kuranu ndoci beyn najin nana'ana koma u'sangwa "Gangan: U-- yin ya mi yin'a umajin kagbo mi yin'a na mia san'ugwa wo be ti mi yin na'a.

Surah 10:16,                 Say: "If Allah had so willed I should not have rehearsed it to you nor would He have made it known to you. A whole life-time before this have I tarried amongst you: will ye not then understand"Gangan: ",Wun'aba Soko ba da mia gba'u wo ya ye yea da mima'ala kpikpeu wu ye woa hakika mi fedun dan tacin yebo eya nazhi dokun na shidzo be dzo kafi wahayi'u be na.

Surah 10:17  ,           Who doth more wrong than such as forge a lie against Allah or deny His Signs But never will prosper those who sin.,Ngba zi'i wu'ye gan za nae tswa ganmana ta Soko nao koma ucia aya'uzhi yi ganmana nao Hakika le fi jin ci zhi'atso guria
Surah 10:18    ,                        They serve besides Allah things that hurt them not nor profit them and they say: "These are our intercessors with Allah." Say: "Do ye indeed inform Allah of something He knows not in the heavens or on earth- Glory to Him! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)!",Acie jin bauta ya yandocizhi ke Soko lugwa yannazhi la egun tsoa woa ama la yandoci anfani jin'a woa na acie gangan: "Nanazhi ga'tangwa yayi eba Soko bo.

Surah 10:19,                Mankind was but one nation but differed (later). Had it not been for a word that went forth before from thy Lord their differences would have been settled between them.,Zawangizhi (kpata) ma fea saide al'umma nini gancin acia cedozhi le ba kaujin ebo egan na'ashidzo dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo na'a da aga hukunci ba tsakaniabo eti yanazhie ce dozhi leba fi minubo na.
Surah 10:20,               They say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord" Say: "The Unseen is only for Allah (to know) then wait ye: I too will wait with you.",Acia jin afe gangan: ki'i la aci cin aya zankpe ndoci be yau dagan eba Tsoci u boa yin'o "Gangan: Hakika de (kpikpe) yanna swo kpata na be Soko yin'udan'o.

Surah 10:21,                     When We make mankind taste of some mercy after adversity hath touched them behold! they take to plotting against Our Signs! Say: "Swifter to plan is Allah!"

Surah 10:23   ,                     But when he delivereth them behold! they transgress insolently through the earth in defiance of right!

Surah 10:24     ,                                     The likeness of the life of the present is as the rain which We send down from the skies: by its mingling arises the produce of the earth- which provides food for men and animals: (It grows) till the earth is clad with its golden ornaments and is decked out (in beauty): the people to whom it belongs think they have all powers of disposal over it: There reaches it Our command by night or by day and We make it like a harvest clean-mown as if it had not flourished only the day before! thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who reflect.,Hakika de kotonci yan edunfe izhe ke nuwan na uyio na Yi duzhin dagan sanmaona gancin yandzo yan kinzhi cia zhinkeba be uyin (eyandzo) na zwangizhie gi to dabbazhi na harda kamina kin ga eyan wangiuzhi wan sungwa wangi na ucia pa nin na gancin zanazhi wun latina cia fe kpaye gan aga wun iko ta eti'ubo ala'ali ma foro yi gae dazan ta eti'ubo yeshii ko igidi yin'o gancin Yi ci gau la'azhe kin na a yandondo'u kuani na ke wyoa gan gan ujin wyun ga she be yangici zhi tsuwoanao.

Surah 10:27 ,                         But those who have earned evil will have a reward of like evil: ignominy will cover their (faces): No defender will they have from (the wrath of) Allah: Their faces will be covered as it were with pieces from the depth of the darkness of night: they are companions of the Fire: they will abide therein (for aye)!,Zanazhi ma da cewo etun dedezhi na egagba dede kotonci na'ace na uga a deo zunyesun be egbae ma gaawangi.

Surah 10:30  ,             There will every soul prove (the fruits of) the deeds it sent before: they will be brought back to Allah their rightful Lord and their invented falsehoods will leave them in the lurch.,Kanga rayi ndondo otsoa kpe egagba etun nazhi ula shidzo nao aci ga'a ku da tsun Soko nayi Ndakata'a yan gaskiya na yannazhi ma afe tswa kpata na ci ga'a gbin'ayeo.

Surah 10:37  ,                   This Qur´an is not such as can be produced by other than Allah; on the contrary it is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before it and a fuller explanation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord of the worlds.,Alkuranu na na ma wun'aye jin na'agau tswa wo uma'ajin Sokoa na'a yin'a ammade litafi uyio nae wu gaskiya yabo yan litafi nazhi shidzona umae jin bayani hukunci nazhi fi litafio na kelokezhin ndondo danboa dagan eba Etsu nae kpa alitta zhi kpata na bo ufebo.

Surah 10:39  ,                Nay they charge with falsehood that whose knowledge they cannot compass even before the elucidation thereof hath reached them: thus did those before them make charges of falsehood: but see what was the end of those who did wrong!A'a ade a yanna kpikpea makezhea na yi ganmana bayanizhi ma laa be ya a Acinga ga zanazhi shiadzo na yiu ganmanao.

Surah 10:45     ,              One day He will gather them together: (It will be) as if they had tarried but an hour of a day: they will recognise each other: assuredly those will be lost who denied the meeting with Allah and refused to receive true guidance.,Fona ma uga kuaa yekan na uga'fe ke a fedun izhe lea sai de ke yan lokaci ndoci de'gi igidio na; acia kpe dozhi ye kanga.

Surah 12:68  ,                           And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined it did not profit them in the least against (the plan of) Allah: It was but a necessity of Jacob´s soul which he discharged.

Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that Allah willed it (so).

The leader among them said: "Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah´s name and how before this ye did fail in your duty with Joseph Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me or Allah commands me; and He is the best to command.,Kamina abea kauna ba beuyin eti aye wa nao naaci da kapa-nni fe da baza Nunsa'a ci gan: Beke ye kpewo gan baba ye-yea alkawali la be ye yin yan tsakani ye be Soko yin'ana Yetso ma kpe iri eye na ye ya be be Yusufu'I na to mide a ya kin yan Misra'a har she babami ga mi ya izini yan zhinzhin koma Sokou jin hukunci naga bauna be mi yin.

He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you (all here) out of the desert (even) after Satan had sown enmity between me and my brothers.

Surah 12:109,                            Nor did We send before thee (as messengers) any but men whom we did inspire- (men) living in human habitations.

Surah 12:110   ,               (Respite will be granted) until when the messengers give up hope (of their people) and (come to) think that they were treated as liars there reaches them Our help and those whom We will are delivered into safety. But never will be warded off our punishment from those who are in sin.,Harda kamina Tucizhi ga kauna ba (be imani jin yan jama'a yan'azhi na) acia hakika ya ke de a ayi ganmana zunci zhi na kanga ga taimako Yi e be ya'ao.

Surah 12:111     ,                 There is in their stories instruction for men endued with understanding.

Surah 14:5                    We sent Moses with Our signs (and the command). "Bring out thy people from the depths of da,rkness into light and teach them to remember the Days of Allah."

Surah 14:24              Seest thou not how Allah sets forth a parable - A goodly word like a goodly tree whose root is firmly, fixed and its branches (reach) to the heavens- of its Lord. So Allah sets forth parables for men in order that they may receive admonition.,Wyo le kendoe Soko la misali la be na'a Egan lilici (man-nagi) ke cigban mannagi na uyio gbereu wun'a wankin wangi gwalauzhi ma kpe sanmao.

Surah 16:26 ,                   Those before them did also plot (against Allah´s Way): but Allah took their structures from their foundations and the roof fell down on them from above; and the Wrath seized them from directions they did not perceive.,Hakika zanazhi shiadzo na ajin shiri yan makirinci Soko cia emi nazhia tu na gbin ya dagan ekpouzhio yannazhi a la kpeu na cia kpan be kpea dagan titaabo azaba ci dabe ya'a dagan bana a kpayetua na.

Surah 16:28   ,               "(Namely) those whose lives the angels take in a state of wrong-doing to their own souls."

(The angels will reply) "Nay but verily Allah knoweth all that ye did;(A g a y I ) ,zanazhi kamina malaikazhi gea -- rayi bea yin na aafe zanazhia eti tacin'ajin zwalunci na atso ciga kpatsun ta acia gangan: yi ma fe za nazhie lo tun dede ndoci na'ani.

Surah 16:33   ,                  Do the (ungodly) wait until the angels come to them or there comes the Command of thy Lord (for their doom) So did those who went before them. But Allah wronged them not: nay they wronged their own souls.,Ngan yandondo danbo na (kafirizhi) e tu ye na'a sai de Malaikazhi (nazhia la azaba be ya na) koma foro yan Tsoci wyoe ndoci na'abe yaa na acinga ga zanazhi be shiadzo na jin'o.

Surah 16:35     ,                          The worshippers of false gods say: "If Allah had so willed we should not have worshipped aught but Him - neither we nor our fathers- nor should we have prescribed prohibitions other than His." So did those who went before them. But what is the mission of messengers but to preach the Clear Message,Zanazhi la yan pa Soko baci na gan: "wun'a ba Soko ba da yi yia jin bauta ya zandondo baci Soko boa to yi to yanmanciyizhi da yi maa la yandoci azhe haramu baci na Soko la jin haramu na boa" Acinga ga zanazhi be shiadzo na jin'o. Ngan yandondo ta eti Tuci boa saide eyan-wu yan gbangba.
Surah 16:36   ,                        For We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger (with the Command) "Serve Allah and eschew Evil": of the People were some whom Allah guided and some on whom error became inevitably (established). So travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who denied (the Truth).,Hakika ma yi tun Tuci tun dan mini alumma ndondo kede: "Ejin bauta ya Soko ye mae kpe ya be shetan yin nae." Miniabo ade nazhi Sokoa wuba na amade dan miniabo nazhi egbin'ajin tabbata ta etiabo na (harda fo mi ajaliana).

Surah 16:37,             If thou art anxious for their guidance yet Allah guideth not such as He leaves to stray and there is none to help them.,Ka da ma wyogae bavun eti ekokeabo to hakika Sokoe la zana ugaa gbin na ke ekoa amade zandondo danbo naajin'a taimako naa.
Surah 16:38  ,               They swear their strongest oaths by Allah that Allah will not raise up those who die: Nay but it is a promise (binding) on Him in truth: but most among mankind realise it not.,Ama zhi kuti be Sokoe lo iyaka yan gaskiya boa (na'akpena) kede: zana ga'atsu na Sokoa na'akin bea na. A'a ujin acin'a (ekin na Alkiyami) alkawali uyio yan gaskiya na Soko jin na amaade ekun dondo zawangizhi kpea.
Surah 16:39 ,         (They must be raised up) in order that He may manifest to them the truth of that wherein they differ and that the rejecters of Truth may realise that they had indeed (surrendered to) Falsehood.,(Soko ga alittazhi la nakin) Ebo ujin bayani'uya'a yan yannazhi aga cedozhi leba etiubo na ebo ma to kafirizhia kpeawo kede hakika aya'afe ganmana zuncizhi na.
Surah 16:40 ,        For to anything which We have willed We but say the word "Be" and it is.,Hakika yanna yia jin yi gan be yandoci kamina Yi ga kpa gan Yia jin'u na yia jin yi gangan: " Afe" Uci ga'afe ga.
Surah 16:41  ,               To those who leave their homes in the cause of Allah after suffering oppression- We will assuredly give a goodly home in this world; but truly the reward of the Hereafter will be greater. If they only realised (this)!,Zanazhi maga kpe la ebo Soko baci na aga jin'a zwalunci na hakika yi ga izhe le wangi jin shiri ya'a egagba yan Alkiyami ma u wancin gan agaafe zanazhi de kpikpe de na.
Surah 16:42  ,  (They are) those who persevere in patience and put their trust on their Lord.,(Agayi) zanazhia hakuri jin nao amaafe zanazhie yakpe Tsocia (dan alamari ndondo nao).
Surah 16:43   ,           And before thee also the messengers We sent were but men to whom We granted inspiration: if ye realise this not ask of those who possess the Message.,Yima la'atun zandoci tun shi wyo dzo lea sai de eza bagizhi nazhi ma Yi ajin yi jin wahayi ya na. Ye mae gbin eza kpikpe nazhie pa Soko na gan wun'a yi gan yede kpikpeana.
Surah 16:44,           (We sent them) with Clear Signs and Books of dark prophecies; and We have sent down unto thee (also) the Message; that thou mayest explain clearly to men what is sent for them and that they may give thought.,(Yi tun'a tun fi ye) be hujjazhi na bayaniazhi tula na to be Litafizhi. Yi ma Alkuranu (yan sinsantu) cin bea ya wyoe ebo wyo jin bayanio ya zazhi yan yannazhi acinbe ya na ujin wo be wuncin'y aga'afe zanazhie kpaye na.
Surah 16:45  ,             Do then those who devise evil (plots) feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up or that the Wrath will not seize them from directions they little perceive-,Ngba zanazhie jin makirinci dedezhi na a sundan gan Soko tan'afi wo be kin yin'a koma azaba'ubeu yaa dagan bana a kpaye tua na'a yan'a
Surah 16:46  ,    Or that He may not call them to account in the midst of their goings to and fro without a chance of their frustrating Him-,Koma u la'au wan kpantsu kui mini dalo dazhin'a zhio ama gan (Soko) gwa woa.
Surah 16:47 ,      Or that He may not call them to account by a process of slow wastage - for thy Lord is indeed full of kindness and mercy.,Koma u la'au wan eti hallaka jin'o karayin. Hakika Tsoci ye Etsu tosayi uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 16:48   ,             Do they not look at Allah´s creation (even) among (inanimate) things- How their (very) shadows turn round from the right and the left prostrating themselves to Allah and that in the humblest manner,Kashi acin le lo eba yannazhi Soko jin na'a ndondo miniabo fifingi azhie yagwa lo gwa'alo to gwa'apinzhi amae jin sujada ya Soko amae dakpya zhizhi baeni boa.
Surah 16:49 ,            And to Allah doth obeisance all that is in the heavens and on earth whether moving (living) creatures or the angels: for none are arrogant (before their Lord).,Yannazhi fi sanmao kpata na to nazhi fi kinbo mini dabbazhio na kpata Soko gae jin sujada yao amae lati dan fin boa.Surah 16:50      They all revere their Lord high above them and they do all that they are commanded.E sundan Tsoci dagan fitiabo amae jin yan na aga jin'a foro be jin jin-y-na.

Surah 16:115 ,                    He has only forbidden you dead meat and blood and the flesh of swine and any (food) over which the name of other than Allah has been invoked.

Surah 16:116    ,                 But say not - for any false thing that your tongues may put forth- "This is lawful and this is forbidden" so as to ascribe false things to Allah.

Surah 17:15  ,                  Who receiveth guidance receiveth it for his own benefit: who goeth astray doth so to his own loss: No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another: nor would We visit with Our Wrath until We had sent an messenger (to give warning).,Zana gaa ke eko na to uke eko ke ya ti tacin'u zana ma gaa gbin na u gbin gbin ya tiu.

Surah 18:45 ,                     Set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world: It is like the rain which we send down from the skies: the earth´s vegetation absorbs it but soon it becomes dry stubble which the winds do scatter: it is (only) Allah who prevails over all things.,Wyo mao ya'a kotonci yan edunfe izhe (kendoe uyi na) ke nuwan na uyio na Yi duzhin dagan sanmao na gancin yandzo yan kin zhi cia bokeba beuyin gancin uci bea wo kpakparae efezhi cie ku'uza (kendoe bauna).

Surah 18:58   ,               But your Lord is Most forgiving full of Mercy.

Surah 2:4,And who believe in the Revelation sent to thee and sent before thy time and (in their hearts) have the assurance of the Hereafter,To za nazhia gaskiya ya de yan na acin de ya wyoe na to na acin de shi-wyo dzo na ama hakika ya de efo zobae na.
Surah 2:5,They are on (true) guidance from their Lord and it is these who will prosper,Za wuncinzhi ata etib eko gboro-na fe de dagan nko Tsocia bo na Za wuncin zhi ma a ga yi za nazhi atso gurinao.
Surah 2:6,As to those who reject Faith it is the same to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe,Hakika za nazhia cin manabo be sokoena ye'ni uyi eba'abo ka wyo ga jin'a gangba ko ma wyo ga jin'a ma a ga ya gaskiya'a.
Surah 2:7,Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing and on their eyes is a veil; great is the penalty they (incur),Soko'a eyan te ba yangban'zhio to tupka'azhio yebo ma'arupke'a eyeazhio azaba na ma gbota na ga'jin tabbata ya'a
Surah 2:8,Of the people there are some who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day" but they do not (really) believe,A ma de dan mini zawangizhio za na ' ajin u da egan -gan gan : "zobae na" alali ma ajin muminizhia (ganmana-e-zun'o).
Surah 2:9,Fain would they deceive Allah and those who believe but they only deceive themselves and realise (it) not!,A cie le ye gan a ye ta soko to zanazhia imani jin na alali ma ujin zandondo e taa sai eti tacin'atso amma'a atso santua.
Surah 2:10,In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease: And grievous is the penalty they (incur) because they are false (to themselves),Batan ndoci fi mini yangban'azhio soko cike zhea batan ndoci la'abea be gancin azaba na tan sarauyin nan ajin tabbata ya'a ebo etun nazhi afe lo yan ganmanan na.
Surah 2:11,When it is said to them: "Make not mischief on the earth" they say: "Why we only Want to make peace!",Ama ga gan ya'a gan: "Ega fe nyin-yanzhi kpe eti kinbo ma"a tso'ajin agan: :Hakika yi za nazhie ta yanzhidzu cie jin gya'ara na yi yio".
Surah 2:12,Of a surety they are the ones who make mischief but they realise (it) not.,A' a akika a za wuncin zhi a gayi za nazhie nyi yan nao amma'ade esantua.
Surah 2:13,When it is said to them: "Believe as the others believe:" They say: "Shall we believe as the fools believe" Nay of a surety they are the fools but they do not know,Gancin aga gan ya-agan: yea imani jin kendoe ezazhi (nayncin'azhi) jin imanina"Ajin agan :" yi-la imani-jin kendoewawazhi jin imaninaA'a akika atso nnazhiy a ga yi wawazhio ammaa akpea.
Surah 2:14,When they meet those who believe they say: "We believe;" but when they are alone with their evil ones they say: "We are really with you: We (were) only jesting.",Gancin ka mina aga bea bokeba be za nazhia imani jin nae ajin agan gan"yi ya imani jin' ka mina uga bea ke'atso dan eba shai-tan nayincin'azhio na ajin agan :"Hkika be ye yin ga yi dan'o hakika yi delamila kawanyin.
Surah 2:15,Allah will throw back their mockery on them and give them rope in their trespasses; so they will wander like blind ones (To and fro),Soko'a wo'a gbata dede be emi na'ala na. umaa two gban ya'a danmini ragbanshi bo har aciga na gboye.
Surah 2:16,These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their traffic is profitless and they have lost true direction,za wuncinzhia ga yi za nazhi'a egbin shi be bawu'ynao woce wun cin na'ace na u'dzun be ele yin'a atso maajin eza bawu zhia.
Surah 2:17,Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all around him Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness. So they could not see,Kotoncin yan za wuncinzhi uyi ke kotonchi 'za na ena gun-na kamina haske yan ena a"'la she yan nazhi ma"'u gwoba kpata na soko cia haske'a  wuncin la"ake ya bo ucia ya fi bazhikozhio acie leba yea
Surah 2:18,Deaf dumb and blind they will not return (to the path),Tukpatencizhi edingizhi yeboncizhi ebo acin'o azhin eko gboro bea.
Surah 2:19 ,Or (another similitude) is that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky: In it are zones of darkness and thunder and lightning: They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap the while they are in terror of death. But Allah is ever round the rejecters of Faith!,Ko ma kotonkoci-ayi ke girgije na'ashe be ele ucie du zhin daga sanmao na miniubo bazhi kozhi danbo to kara yan ra'di to sanmadzwan acie la egwa gingini-nazhi fi tukpa'azhio ebo dansu yan tsutsuo akika sokoa yanna kafirizhi dan'yi ninbo na makezhe.
Surah 2:20,The lightning all but snatches away their sight; every time the light (Helps) them they walk therein and when the darkness grows on them they stand still. And if Allah willed He could take away their faculty of hearing and seeing; for Allah hath power over all things,(Sanmadzwan wuncin) wun' etsoba ke yan na'a-- ba yeleazhi be ayin na kami ndondo na uga la haske fia na ajin afe dazan fi miniubo kamina-ma uga bea shi zhiko fia na a ajin agikini.

Surah 2:21O ,ye people! Adore your Guardian-Lord who created you and those who came before you that ye may have the chance to learn righteousness;,Ya ye zawangizhi ! Ejin bauta ya Tsoci-ye natso jin alita ye na to ye to zanazhi shi ye dzo na ko be wuncin ye ga'fe za nazhia tswa soko acia sundan'u na
Surah 2:22,Who has made the earth your couch and the heavens your canopy; and sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for your sustenance; then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know (the truth).,(Etsu) na ta kin ci ci ya ye parae na uci ke zhea sanma kan gikini tutuci uci du elezhin dagan sanmao ucie wa yangici sun-sunzhi tinya be ele ebo ulau fe arziki'u yaye nao.

Surah 2:23,And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Our servant then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your witnesses or helpers (If there are any) besides Allah if your (doubts) are true,Uma ga 'fe gan ye jin shakkajin be yanna yi cin beyn ya wuzhi yi na to yetsoe be be ka wun'a yi sura niniy na'ayi dozhi'u na wun'ayi eza gaskiyazhi ga ye yio na.
Surah 2:24,But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones- which is prepared for those who reject Faith.,Ka'gan ye be jin woa to ye ma'ajin woa (har da zoba izhea) e' tobo wuncin'o e sundan azaba yan ena natso yan'na aga gun'una uga yi zawangizhi be takunzhi-yin'ona.Ama jin'a tattali jin ya kafirizhi.
Surah 2:25,But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness that their portion is Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom they say: "Why this is what we were fed with before" for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein (for ever).,wyo mao ya'labari yan gban-fa'o-ya za nazhia imani jin acie lo'tun wangizhi na kede hakika ayibe emi aljannazhi nazhi nuwan zhie je fi tako abo na.Kandondo na a ga ya'yangicizhi dagan mini yangici sun sunzhi yan aljanna o na ajin a gan:ngan nana ga;ala ya yi ga le'anio (ebo bibe naabe dozhi eyeo nao )a cia fe la'u be ya:aciafe yan nazhi bedozhi naGancin ade fi mini aljannazhio yinmi lilicizhi a tso ma ga afe fi mini ubo fife yan yan gbegben-na.
Surah 2:26,Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things lowest as well as highest. Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but those who reject Faith say: "What means Allah by this similitude" By it He causes many to stray and many He leads into the right path; but He causes not to stray except those who forsake (the path), Hakika soko wun'e sun zunye'a na wun'a la misali (yan gaskiya )wu ye naa ka wunayi be ke emagi yin'o ko be yandoci nagan'acin na.

Surah 2:27,Those who break Allah´s Covenant after it is ratified and who sunder what Allah Has ordered to be joined and do mischief on earth: These cause loss (only) to themselves,Za nazhie lo alkawali soko ya na ba ci na u'ta kpankoro na amae la gingan be bibae dan yan na Soko jin foro gan a la wun'a gun na a mae nyin yanzhi fi mini kinbo na za wunccinzhi a ga yi eza asara zhio.
Surah 2:28,How can ye reject the faith in Allah- seeing that ye were without life and He gave you life; then will He cause you to die and will again bring you to life; and again to Him will ye return,Ke'u be yiyi ye cie cin manabo ye cie jin kafirinci be Sokoe nao alalima ye ya'fe eyan tsutsu cizhi bedzo gancin Sokocia ye dan rayi gancin ucia kezhe bea ye wu gancin ebau ga'akuye zheban da tsun'o.
Surah 2:29,It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth; Moreover His design comprehended the heavens for He gave order and perfection to the seven firmaments; and of all things He hath perfect knowledge,Wyun gayi za najin alitta ya ye yan yan nazhi fi kinbo kpata nao gancin u cia jin daidai (be yan nazhi ukpa na) lo eba sama gancin jin daidai har sama gutwaba.

Surah 2:30,Behold thy Lord said to the angels: "I will create a vicegerent on earth." They said: "Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)" He said: "I know what ye know not.",(Wyo mao pa) ka mi na Tsoci wyoe gan gan be malaikazhi gan: hakika miga alifa (za na'agi kini ya alamari mizhi nan ) laa shi kinbo.

Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith.,(wyo mao pa) lokaci na yi gan be malaikazhi gan: E jin sujada (yan cinwan) ya Adamu na gancin kpata' aci da sujada sai dai ibilisu U navo u ma'a gbotika ucia fe dan mini kafirizhio.

Surah 2:36,Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden) and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: "Get ye down all (ye people) with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for a time.",Shaitan cia ta ke emi Aljanna lugwa u cia wadzun tinya ke emi ni'ima na'adan nin yan'ubo na lugwa.

Surah 2:60,And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: "Strike the rock with thy staff." Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each group knew its own place for water.

Surah 2:68,They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what (heifer) it is!" He said; "He says: The heifer should be neither too old nor too young but of middling age. Now do what ye are commanded!",Aci gan: Ba ya yi be tsoci wyo yin ujin bayani'u yayi kiy nanko wuncin yi o Ugan Akika wyun'e gan gan:Akika nanko ude yi tatacin wuncizhi ebo acin'o yea etun lo be foro naajin ye na.

Surah 2:71,He said: "He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields; sound and without blemish." They said: "Now hast thou brought the truth." Then they offered her in sacrifice but not with good-will.,U ci gan: Akika wyun'e gagan:Akika nanko tsa uyio ujin na'ajin foro cie nunu kinbo na;aumae ya yangici latizhi nuwan fin'a uyi be lafiyae wangi  u de etinzhi fi nakan boa.

Surah 2:73,So We said: "Strike the (body) with a piece of the (heifer)." Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His Signs: Perchance ye may understand.,Gancin yi ci gan: E dan'u yan be sashi'u yin (yan nanko na'a zun na ).

Surah 2:74,Thenceforth were your hearts hardened: They became like a rock and even worse in hardness. For among rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth; others there are which when split asunder send forth water; and others which sink for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do.,Gancin yangban yezhi cia wo kpakpara yin zuma yan wunci'o. U cia zhe ke takuna na koma uke wo kpakparae gan takun.

Surah 2:81,Nay those who seek gain in evil and are girt round by their sins- they are companions of the Fire: Therein shall they abide (For ever).,Acin gao zandondo na ga da cewo dede na har ma lefiu cia ma'u gwoba na akika za wuncinzhi gayi egimi 'nazhio a ma'afi nin yan ubo fi gbegben na.

Surah 2:83,And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (to this effect): Worship none but Allah; treat with kindness your parents and kindred and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer; and practise regular charity. Then did ye turn back except a few among you and ye backslide (even now).,lokaci na la alkawali ya Banu Israilazhi na ega jin bawta ya yan ndondo ma sai Soko ye mea fe jin bolobolo ya yanmanci guba'ba to dangi yan tsonbazhi .

Surah 2:85,After this it is ye the same people who slay among yourselves and banish a party of you from their homes; assist (Their enemies) against them in guilt and rancour; and if they come to you as captives ye ransom them though it was not lawful for you to banish them. Then is it only a part of the Book that ye believe in and do ye reject the rest but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty. For Allah is not unmindful of what ye do.,Gancin yetso dan na ye zhe egya dozhi ya ye mae la sashi yezhi yan tinya daga emiazhio yacie jin dozhi taimako etiabo be jin jin lefiy be binakun'y. za nazhi yi za win-wacizhi na a ga be eba yae yegwo sisa egwa'abo be yandociy alalima aramu uyio yaye na yea yan'a tinya na. kashi ye ga'a imani jin be sashi yan na litafi gan na yeci ga'ajin kafirinci be sashiy Ngba ki yi egagba yan za na gae jin acin mini yebo nao saide egba be zunyesun'y dan mini edunfe izheo gancin efo alkiyamiy aga'aku da'afi azaba na tan gan nao.

Surah 2:87,We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers; We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear (Signs) and strengthened him with the holy spirit. Is it that whenever there comes to you a messenger with what ye yourselves desire not .ye are puffed up with pride- Some ye called impostors and others ye slay!,Akika ma yi la litafi a ya Musa yi cia Tucizhi gba'u zunma'o be yi cia bayani be hujjazhiy la'aya Isa egi Maryamu yi ci u ya kagbo be Rayililiciy (ugayi Jibrilu o).Ngba kamindondo na tuci ga be ya ye be yanna ba yangbanye yea na ye'a gbotika bea yin yecia kansan ndoci yi ganmana kansan ndoci ma ye la'a wu.

Surah 2:89,And when there comes to them a Book from Allah confirming what is with them- although from of old they had prayed for victory against those without Faith- when there comes to them that which they (should) have recognised they refuse to believe in it but the curse of Allah is on those without Faith.,Kamina litafi be ya'a dagan eba soko na natso mae wu gaskiya yan yannazhi fi gwa'abo na amaafe kanga afe wa taimako ta eti yan kafirizhio.

Surah 2:90,Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls in that they deny (the revelation) which Allah has sent down in insolent envy that Allah of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases: Thus have they drawn on themselves Wrath upon Wrath. And humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith.,Tir jam be yan na ada la rayizhi shi na na har ajin kafirinci be yanna soko cin beyn na ebo yangban dedeo naejin be falala soko na'ucin yan'u be ya za na ga bau mini wuzhi'u zhio na.

Surah 2:93,And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): "Hold firmly to what We have given you and hearken (to the Law)": They said:We hear and we disobey:" And they had to drink into their hearts (of the taint) of the calf because of their Faithlessness.

Surah 2:96,Thou wilt indeed find them of all people most greedy of life-even more than the idolaters: Each one of them wishes He could be given a life of a thousand years: But the grant of such life will not save him from (due) punishment. For Allah sees well all that they do.,Wyo ma'a tsun'n a ga yi za nazhi de cincin rayuwa izhe gan zazhi nao; ade cincin izhe gan to za nazhie la'yan pa Soko baci na. zaeni miniabo wun'ajin ufe wa ko wun'ga'ade izhe le yan eya kpautsun wuncin ma u'ala kpeya wo be azaba yin'a ka'aga yau cia de le na.

Surah 2:101,And when there came to them a messenger from Allah confirming what was with them a party of the people of the Book threw away the Book of Allah behind their backs as if (it had been something) they did not know!,Kamina tuci be ya'a dagan eba Soko na namae la gaskiyabo wu yan yanna dan ganni be ayin na zandocizhi mini za nazhi ala litafi yana a litafi Soko la'ace ya ci zuma'abo aci fejin bojin ke ad kpikpea na.
Surah 2:102,They followed what the evil ones gave out (falsely) against the power of Solomon: the blasphemers Were not Solomon but the evil ones teaching men Magic and such things as came down at babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (Such things) without saying: "We are only for trial; so do not blaspheme." They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah´s permission. And they learned what harmed them not what profited them. And they knew that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls if they but knew!,Acia emi tu katun na shaitan egba ya'a eti mulki Sulaimauo na Sulaiymanu ma ujin kafirincia ama de shaitanzhi ga jin kafiricio.

Surah 2:158,Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah. So if those who visit the House in the Season or at other times should compass them round it is no sin in them.

Surah 2:217,They ask thee concerning fighting in the Prohibited Month. Say: "Fighting therein is a grave (offence); but graver is it in the sight of Allah to prevent access to the path of Allah to deny Him to prevent access to the Sacred Mosque and drive out its members." Tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter. Nor will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. And if any of you Turn back from their faith and die in unbelief their works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter; they will be companions of the Fire and will abide therein.,E'gbin wyo gan eti etswa Alfurmao.

And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of advantage) over them.

These are the limits ordained by Allah; so do not transgress them if any do transgress the limits ordained by Allah such persons wrong (Themselves as well as others).,Yawo la (natsode gyara na) gubauyio.

Surah 2:256,Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things.,Ti;ile bo ko kpaka bo udan mini jin jin adini boa (ya zana la'agwo musuluncia na'a) Akika bawu wun'a tula kperi be egbiny ebo acin'o zandondo na ga 'kafirici jinbe Dagutuy na (zanae jin zazhi umurni be wunwun zandoci ke Soko lugwa na) u cia imani jin be Sokoe na akika za wuncin'a egwa la'asun egban na gboka sarauyin nana ma'adza ya'a na Soko ma Etsu nae wo yandondo na uyio Etsu nade kpikpe yandondo na uyi
Surah 2:257,Allah is the Protector of those who have faith: from the depths of darkness He will lead them forth into light. Of those who reject faith the patrons are the evil ones: from light they will lead them forth into the depths of darkness. They will be companions of the fire to dwell therein (For ever),Soko ga yi Ndakata yan za nazhia imani jin nao wyun'e kuadzun tinya dagan bazhiko zhio lo haske za nazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na Ndakata'azhi gayi Dagutuo ajin afe kuatinya dagan haskeo lo bazhikozhi.

Surah 2:258,Hast thou not Turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham About his Lord because Allah had granted him power Abraham said: "My Lord is He Who Giveth life and death." He said: "I give life and death". Said Abraham: "But it is Allah that causeth the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause him to rise from the West." Thus was he confounded who (in arrogance) rejected faith. Nor doth Allah Give guidance to a people unjust.,Ngba wyu le ye eba za na gbomi be Ibrahimae dan mini alamari Tsocioubo ebo mulki na Soko la'ayau na'a lokaci na Ibrahima gan: "Tsoci mi gae dan eyan rayio wyu ga mae wu rayio Ugan: "Tomi tsoe dan yan rayi mi mae wu rayi.

Surah 2:259,Or (take) the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet all in ruins to its roofs. He said: "Oh! how shall Allah bring it (ever) to life after (this) its death" but Allah caused him to die for a hundred years then raised him up (again). He said: "How long didst thou tarry (thus)" He said: (Perhaps) a day or part of a day." He said: "Nay thou hast tarried thus a hundred years; but look at thy food and thy drink; they show no signs of age; and look at thy donkey: And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people Look further at the bones how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh." When this was shown clearly to him he said: "I know that Allah hath power over all things.",Koma ke za na -- gan alkarya ndocio na alalima wun' azhe wasa ta eti eyanko'uzhio uci gan: ke Soko zhezhe ci dan kin nana rayi baci tsutsu'ubo nao Sokocia wuntso wu har yan eya shitsun zuma wuncin'o uci'u la'a nakin be rayiy Uci gbin' ugan gan: "Ke efo jin wyoe yiyinao.

Surah 2:260,When Abraham said: "Show me Lord how You will raise the dead " He replied: "Have you no faith" He said "Yes but just to reassure my heart." Allah said "Take four birds draw them to you and cut their bodies to pieces. Scatter them over the mountain-tops then call them back. They will come swiftly to you. Know that Allah is Mighty Wise.",To lokaci na Ibrahima gan gan: Tsoci! La' wu mi kendoe wyoe la rayi dan eyan tsutsucizhi na. Ugan: kashi wyo ya gaskiya ya'a Ugan: "Na'am!

Surah 2:261,The parable of those who spend their substance in the way of Allah is that of a grain of corn: it groweth seven ears and each ear Hath a hundred grains. Allah giveth manifold increase to whom He pleaseth: And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things.,Kotonci yan za nazhie wu dukiya'azhi fi eko Soko na uyi ke kotonci yan eyisunsun na'ayin egwa gutwaba na mini egwa ndondo yangici sunsun shitsun fi bo.

Surah 2:262,Those who spend their substance in the cause of Allah and follow not up their gifts with reminders of their generosity or with injury-for them their reward is with their Lord: on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.,Za nazhie wu dukiya'azhi fi eko Soko na gancin ma e'la'zhisa be egun'y a gba yan na a wuna zuma'a na ayibe la'ada'yin dan eba Soko dansun ndondo ma'adan bea yin'a ama'a nyin yangban ndodoa.
Surah 2:264,O ye who believe! cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury- like those who spend their substance to be seen of men but believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. They are in parable like a hard barren rock on which is a little soil: on it falls heavy rain which leaves it (Just) a bare stone. They will be able to do nothing with aught they have earned. And Allah guideth not those who reject faith.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 2:265,And the likeness of those who spend their substance seeking to please Allah and to strengthen their souls is as a garden high and fertile: heavy rain falls on it but makes it yield a double increase of harvest and if it receives not Heavy rain light moisture sufficeth it. Allah seeth well whatever ye do.,Kotonci ma yan za nazhie wu dukya'azhi ebo wiwayan yardajin yan Soko na be kagbo yan yangban' atsozhi (eba imanio na) uyi ke kotonci yan batako ndoci na ta eti patio na eleko (yan albarka) cia du kpeu na.

Surah 2:266,Does any of you wish that he should have a garden with date-palms and vines and streams flowing underneath and all kinds of fruit while he is stricken with old age and his children are not strong (enough to look after themselves)- that it should be caught in a whirlwind with fire therein and be burnt up Thus doth Allah make clear to you (His) Signs; that ye may consider.,Kashi eza dan mini yebo nae wa gan wyun'u yi bebatako yan donbinazhi to yinabizhi na manuwanzhie je fi tako ubo na yangici sunsun iri ndondo ma' ashe u wyuntso ci bea kuku umayi be zuriyazhi nazhi la'agboka na gancin efe ko ndoci na enafinin yin'ubo na cibea lati din na.

Surah 2:267,O ye who believe! Give of the good things which ye have (honourably) earned and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you and do not even aim at getting anything which is bad in order that out of it ye may give away something when ye yourselves would not receive it except with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Free of all wants and worthy of all praise.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Efe wu mini dukiya wangiyezhio nazhi ye cewoa na to mini yan nazhi yi la tinya ya ye dagan kinbo na ye mae ga kpa lulo etun dede mini ubo ma ye mae ga fe wu yanna ka aga yaye yea gwo'a na ma ko na kaye ga gwo ye ga eye findanna ma.

Surah 2:268,The Evil one threatens you with poverty and bids you to conduct unseemly. Allah promiseth you His forgiveness and bounties. And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things.,She'tan wyin'ejin ye alkawali yaji jin umae jinye umurni be lulo yan etun alfashae. Soko mae jin ye alkawali yan etun gafara be falalae dagan eba' ubo. Sokoma Etsu bagwo uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio.
Surah 2:269,He granteth wisdom to whom He pleaseth; and he to whom wisdom is granted receiveth indeed a benefit overflowing; but none will grasp the Message but men of understanding.,Wyun' ela hikima (fahimta gaskiya) a twarya ya za na ga ba una zandondo na ma aga hikima la'aya na akika aza wuncin ya alherina dokun na. A made za na' akpaye na'a sai de za nazhi gayi eza hankalizhi na.
Surah 2:270,And whatever ye spend in charity or devotion be sure Allah knows it all. But the wrong-doers have no helpers.,Yandondo na ye ga wu mini dukiyaezhio na (ba na wun'agbagba da kan na) koma emi yan alkawali ndoci na ye ga shena akika Soko yi be kpikpeu yin. Azwalumizhi ma'ade zanazhia jin'ataimako naa.
Surah 2:271,If ye disclose (acts of) charity even so it is well but if ye conceal them and make them reach those (really) in need that is best for you: It will remove from you some of your (stains of) evil. And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do.,Ye ga swadakazhi la'atula to ugye sarauyin yema ga'uswo ye cia la'aya talakazhi wucintso de alheri gan yaye. Soko ma ga ndoncizhi mini zunubi yezhio fin ya. Soko ma yi be kpikpe etun nazhi ye'lo na.
Surah 2:272,It is not required of thee (O Messenger) to set them on the right path but Allah sets on the right path whom He pleaseth. Whatever of good ye give benefits your own souls and ye shall only do so seeking the "Face" of Allah. Whatever good ye give shall be rendered back to you and ye shall not Be dealt with unjustly.,Eko ke'a udan egwa wyoboa amma'ade Soko ajin ula za na ga bau na ake eko.

Yandondo na ye ga wu mini alherio na Soko ga la'adau gunmi ya ye ama' ajin ye zwaluncia.
Surah 2:273,(Charity is) for those in need who in Allah´s cause are restricted (from travel) and cannot move about in the land seeking (For trade or work): the ignorant man thinks because of their modesty that they are free from want. Thou shalt know them by their (Unfailing) mark: They beg not importunately from all the sundry. And whatever of good ye give be assured Allah knoweth it well.,(Efe' wu dukiya) ya talakazhi nazhia eyanzhi la'akan'a ebo ezan na'eda yankokari ta eti ekpa Sokona ade kagbo na'alo bandondo wo be na'a za na kpea na ga le'aye wyun' aye gan ko eyandecizhio ebo minia nae wan nao. Wyoa kpeaye be ala'amazhiy e'jin zawangizhi bara wawuya yin'a yandondo na ye ga wu mini alherio na akika Soko yi be kpikpe uyin.
Surah 2:274,Those who (in charity) spend of their goods by night and by day in secret and in public have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.,Za nazhie wu dukiya' azhi (fi eko Soko) dan yeshio to igidi na to swiswoci to gbangba na to a yi be la'ada' ayin dan eba Tsociabo dansun ndondo ma'adan beayin'a nyangban nyin ndondo ma'adan bea yin'a.
Surah 2:275,Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the Evil one by his touch Hath driven to madness. That is because they say: "Trade is like usury" but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who after receiving direction from their Lord desist shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for Allah (to judge); but those who repeat (The offence) are companions of the Fire: They will abide therein (for ever).,Za nazhie gi ewo riba na (yan naabe ta eti lisafio na) a nakin efo alkiyami boa sai de kendoe zana efe shetanda zhe nakan cia togwa na kendoe wyun' e nakin nana.

Surah 2:276,Allah will deprive usury of all blessing but will give increase for deeds of charity: For He loveth not creatures ungrateful and wicked.,Sokoe la albarka wa ewo ribao umae la bibe albarka dan ewo swadaka zhio Soko mae wa zandondo na gae ' jin kafirinci na'a umae wa zana ejin le'fi na'a.
Surah 2:277,Those who believe and do deeds of righteousness and establish regular prayers and regular charity will have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.,Akika za nazhia imani jin na aci ke'lo etun wangizhi na acia swallazhi kugikini na acia zakka dukiya' azhi wa na ayi be la'ada ayin dan eba Tsucia bo dansun ndondo ma'dan bea yin'a ama'aleyangbannyin yea.
Surah 2:278,O ye who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains of your demand for usury if ye are indeed believers.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! E sundan Soso ye maela egwa lue lae dan etun ndondo na ga ke yan riba na wu'n ayi Muminizhi ga yeyio na.
Surah 2:279,If ye do it not Take notice of war from Allah and His Messenger: But if ye turn back ye shall have your capital sums: Deal not unjustly and ye shall not be dealt with unjustly.,To kagan ye be lugwa'a to ye kpe wo ke ekun danbo dagan eba Soko be Tuci uyin na Yee ma ga tuba jin yea egwa la'asun Nna yan ewo yeyan asali ye ga jin zandondo gun ma;zandondoma 'uga jin ye gun ma.

Surah 2:280,If the debtor is in a difficulty grant him time Till it is easy for him to repay. But if ye remit it by way of charity that is best for you if ye only knew.,(Za na la gbata na) Uga bea zhe eza ezo (eba gbata yao) epata yau da lokaci na saukia be yau na ye ma ga'la jin swadaka yau wuncin de alheri gan ya ye ye ga kpekpe na.

Surah 2:281,And fear the Day when ye shall be brought back to Allah. Then shall every soul be paid what it earned and none shall be dealt with unjustly.,Ye mae sundsn efo nini ke'te na aga ye la'azheban zhin eba Soko miniubo na. Gancin aciga gbT wo ya rayindondo be iri woce na uga cena zando ma'jin'a gun'a.
Surah 2:282,O ye who believe! When ye deal with each other in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period of time reduce them to writing Let a scribe write down faithfully as between the parties: let not the scribe refuse to write: as Allah Has taught him so let him write. Let him who incurs the liability dictate but let him fear His Lord Allah and not diminish aught of what he owes. If they party liable is mentally deficient or weak or unable Himself to dictate Let his guardian dictate faithfully and get two witnesses out of your own men and if there are not two men then a man and two women such as ye choose for witnesses so that if one of them errs the other can remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when they are called on (For evidence). Disdain not to reduce to writing (your contract) for a future period whether it be small or big: it is juster in the sight of Allah More suitable as evidence and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves but if it be a transaction which ye carry out on the spot among yourselves there is no blame on you if ye reduce it not to writing. But take witness whenever ye make a commercial contract; and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm. If ye do (such harm) it would be wickedness in you. So fear Allah; For it is Good that teaches you. And Allah is well acquainted with all things. If ye are on a journey and cannot find a scribe a pledge with possession (may serve the purpose). And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another let the trustee (faithfully) discharge his trust and let him Fear his Lord conceal not evidence; for whoever conceals it - his heart is tainted with sin. And Allah knoweth all that ye do.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ye ga be cia la gbata ya za yan dan da lokaci ndoci na yi kpikpeci na ye'u ka za na ma ga kau nawyun'u kau be adalinciy.

And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another Let the trustee (Faithfully) discharge His trust and let him fear his Lord. Conceal not evidence; for whoever conceals it- His heart is tainted with sin.

Surah 2:284,To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. Whether ye show what is in your minds or conceal it Allah Calleth you to account for it.

Surah 20:108,            On that Day will they follow the Caller (straight): no crookedness (can they show) him: all sounds shall humble themselves in the Presence of (Allah) Most Gracious: nothing shalt thou hear but the tramp of their feet (as they march).,Efo wuncin aga mitu zanae yia (lo gungun yekan ba na) ade zandondo na'a pan ke eko lugwa na'a be rezhi kpaata ma gaa ta daa kin ebo dansun Soko AL-RAHMANUI ade yanna wyoawo naa sai de bici nae la dazan na.

Surah 20:121   ,           In the result they both ate of the tree and so their nakedness appeared to them: they began to sew together for their covering leaves from the Garden: thus did Adam disobey his Lord and allow himself to be seduced.,Zagubaa ba'a cia gi dagan mini cigban wuncin'o yavun'azhi cia tula zhizhi yaa acife la fini yan Aljanna zhi kan yi taazhi.

Surah 20:130  ,                 Therefore be patient with what they say and celebrate (constantly) the praises of thy Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting; yea celebrate them for part of the hours of the night and at the sides of the day: that thou mayest have (spiritual) joy.,Ebo acin'o a hakuri jin be iri egan nazhi agae gan na wyo mao feo li Tsoci wyoe be jin jin yeboe yau kafi igidi'u la'u tin'uya na be shidzo kafi igidi'u lo mina to mini yeshio to kansan yan igidio u jin wo Sokoa ga wo be yanna wyoa jin yeda be yin-nae.
Surah 20:131 ,                Nor strain thine eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to parties of them the splendour of the life of this world through which We test them: but the provision of thy Lord is better and more enduring.,Wyo mao ga la eye wyo zhi fe cin yannazhi Yi la ya'a yan eman-wo izhe le na ma ninpa uyio yan izhe kawanyin ebo Yii man'aa cin'y-le dan miniubo.

Surah 20:132  ,         Enjoin prayer on thy people and be constant therein. We ask thee not to provide sustenance: We provide it for thee.

Surah 24:32  ,              Marry those among you who are single or the virtuous ones among yourselves male or female: if they are in poverty Allah will give them means out of His grace: for Allah encompasseth all and he knoweth all things.,Ye mae jin yawoe ya ekpanzhi mini yebo to nazhi yi zaguruzhi mini wuzhi bagizhio to wuzhi yinzagizhio na. aga'afe talakazhi to (bele yin ) Sokoajin bagwo ya'a dagan edzunba arzikiUbo Soko ma Etsu bagwo Uyio Etsu kpikpe.
Surah 24:33     ,                                          Let those who find not the wherewithal for marriage keep themselves chaste until Allah gives them means out of His grace. And if any of your slaves ask for a deed in writing (to enable them to earn their freedom for a certain sum) give them such a deed if ye know any good in them: yea give them something yourselves out of the means which Allah has given to you. But force not your maids to prostitution when they desire chastity in order that ye may make a gain in the goods of this life. But if anyone compels them yet after such compulsion is Allah Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful (to them),Zanazhi ma la'ade yanna aga'ajin yawo na'a na ala minia'awan har da kamina Soko ga'ajin bagwo ya'a dagan arzikiUbo na.

Surah 24:34       ,     We have already sent down to you verses making things clear an illustration from (the story of) people who passed away before you and an admonition for those who fear (Allah).,Hakika Yima cin ayazhi be yaye nazhi yi gbangba na amayi kotonci dagan (etan) zanazhi le izhe nana shidzo batsozhio na amayi ewun na ya zanazhi gae sundan Soko na.
Surah 24:35         ,                                      Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The Parable of His Light is as if there were a Niche and within it a Lamp: the Lamp enclosed in Glass: the glass as it were a brilliant star: Lit from a blessed Tree an Olive neither of the east nor of the west whose oil is well-nigh luminous though fire scarce touched it: Light upon Light! Allah doth guide whom He will to His Light: Allah doth set forth Parables for men: and Allah doth know all things.,Soko gayi Hiske-ko yan sanmazhi to kin yin'o kotonci yan HaskeU ke (mishkat)na fitila gun miniu bona;fitila wuncin ma ugun mini kpalabao kpalaba wuncin ma ke wyoa ye gan ko tswangi alu'ului na uyio e dan'udan be emi cigban ndoci na yi yan albarka na na yi yan zaituni na.

Surah 24:36  ,           (Lit is such a Light) in houses which Allah hath permitted to be raised to honour; for the celebration in them of His name: In them is He glorified in the mornings and in the evenings (again and again)-,Dan mini kata nazhi Soko jin foro gan ala'atu na ama'afea tun sunna Soko'a yea fibo amaafe ajin tasbiinu'afibo to laazhin to lozun-na.
Surah 24:37  ,                By men whom neither traffic nor merchandise can divert from the Remembrance of Allah nor from regular Prayer nor from the practice of regular Charity: Their (only) fear is for the Day when hearts and eyes will be transformed (in a world wholly new)-,Eza bagizhi ayio na woce to shishi be kun-kun'y wun'ejin'a shegala ke pipa Soko lugwa'a na. Amae la salla ku gikini amae la zakka wa e sundan efo na yangban'azhi to eyeazhia fe nyan-nyan na.
Surah 24:38     ,        That Allah may reward them according to the best of their deeds and add even more for them out of His Grace: for Allah doth provide for those whom He will without measure.,Ebo ma Soko'U ga'agba be bolo-bolo etun nazhi alona Uma'u nea-bibe dagan mini falalaUbo. Soko mae la arzikiazhi ya zana ga baUna umayi be lisafi yin'a na.
Surah 24:39    ,                 But the Unbelievers- their deeds are like a mirage in sandy deserts which the man parched with thirst mistakes for water; until when he comes up to it he finds it to be nothing: But he finds Allah (ever) with him and Allah will pay him his account: and Allah is swift in taking account.,Zanazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na etun'azhi uyi ke kotonkoci kin na igidi sankpe na dagan ba kpaako zana nuwan'e wo na ga le'uye wyun'a ye gan ko nuwan (yan gaskiyao) har sai kamina ugabe tun baga na wyun'atsun yando ciboa.

Surah 24:40      ,                          Or (the Unbelievers´ state) is like the depths of darkness in a vast deep ocean overwhelmed with billow topped by billow topped by (dark) clouds: depths of darkness one above another: if a man stretches out his hands he can hardly see it! for any to whom Allah giveth not light there is no light!,Koma ke kotonci bazhikozhi dan mini edu na shiko sarauyin na na kunfa yan nuwan'a lakpeu na titaubo be kunfa ndoci ke kpetiubo gancin girgiji ci ta titaubo be.

Surah 24:41 ,                   Seest thou not that it is Allah Whose praises all beings in the heavens and on earth do celebrate and the birds (of the air) with wings outspread Each one knows its own (mode of) prayer and praise. And Allah knows well all that they do.,Wyole ye gan hakika yannazhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo na kpaata'a e li Soko tsatsayin'a acinga to eleugi nazhie ga gwapa'azhi naa Alita ndondo yi be kpikpe ibada na wyun'ajin to lili na wyun'afe li Soko na.

Surah 24:42   ,   Yea to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and to Allah is the final goal (of all).,Soko gama wyun mulki sanmazhi to kin yin'o. Eba'U gabo ma ezhekeba kpaata dan'o.
Surah 24:43  ,                                   Seest thou not that Allah makes the clouds move gently then joins them together then makes them into a heap - then wilt thou see rain issue forth from their midst. And He sends down from the sky mountain masses (of clouds) wherein is hail: He strikes therewith whom He pleases and He turns it away from whom He pleases the vivid flash of His lightning well-nigh blinds the sight.,Wyo le kendoe Sokoajin Ufe da girgijezhi gwa na yea gancin Ucia jin Wyun'a kukeba be dozhi gabcin Uci ga'a latu ta etidozhio wyocia le nuwan ye wun'ajin ufe tinya tsakaniabo Uma'ajin U duzhin dagan sanmao nuwan yan kankarazhi Uciajin udule wuncin fi za na gabaUna Umae lau kan zana ga baUna haske yan sanma dzwan'uzhi e jinke aga eye zawangizhi na-na.

Surah 24:45      ,                        And Allah has created every animal from water: of them there are some that creep on their bellies; some that walk on two legs; and some that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills for verily Allah has power over all things.,Soko ga jin alitta dabba ndondo dagan nuwan bo ade nazhie gba-gba kpe gbako'abo na ade nazhie dazan ta eti bici gubao na amade nazhie dazan ta eti bici gunnio na.

Surah 24:46      ,    We have indeed sent down signs that make things manifest: and Allah guides whom He wills to a way that is straight.,Hakika Yicin ayazhi be nazhi jin bayani yandondo na. Soko ma'ajin U wu zana gabaUna ba lo eko natso yi gboro na.
Surah 24:47     ,         They say "We believe in Allah and in the messenger and we obey": but even after that some of them turn away: they are not (really) Believers.,Aciajin afe gan gan: Yia imani jin be Sokoe to be Tuci'y yima'emi tua. Gancin baci wuncin'o sashi miniabo ci ga zunma zheta zawuncinzhia.
Surah 24:48   ,       When they are summoned to Allah and His messenger in order that He may judge between them behold some of them decline (to come).,Kamina ma aga yia lo eba hukunci Soko be Tuci'Uyin tsakania bo na wyoa tsun ndocizhi miniabo aa dzun gan'abo.
Surah 24:49  ,    But if the right is on their side they come to him with all submission.,Ama gade haki ndoci na'a-- na aa dabe eba Yi be eti didaciy.
Surah 24:50 ,              Is it that there is a disease in their hearts or do they doubt or are they in fear that Allah and His Messenger will deal unjustly with them Nay it is they themselves who do wrong.,Beke batan fi yangban'abo fi na kashi e jin kelokezhin jin kashi e sundan sun gan Soko be TuciUyin ajin'a zwalunci jin A'a atso za wuncinzhi gayi azwalumizhio.
Surah 24:51  ,               The answer of the Believers when summoned to Allah and His Messenger in order that He may judge between them is no other than this: they say "We hear and we obey": it is such as these that will attain felicity.,Hakika egan yan muminizhi de; kamina aga yia lo eba Soko be TuciU yin ebo'ajin hukunci tsakaniabo be dozhi-na kawanyin aajin agan gan:"Yi wo yima emitu".

Surah 24:52      ,   It is such as obey Allah and His Messenger and fear Allah and do right that will win (in the end),Zaeni ndondo nama ga mitu Soko be Tuci'U yin na uci sundan Soko uci tswau na to zawuncinzhi gayi eza robozhio.
Surah 24:53  ,              They swear their strongest oaths by Allah that if only thou wouldst command them they would leave (their homes). Say: "Swear ye not; Obedience is (more) reasonable; verily Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do.",Ama zhi kuti be Sokoe da iyaaka yan kutizhiazhi kede: Wallahi wyo ga jin'a foro gan ala'a tin'aya hakika agaa tinya na.

Surah 24:54                      Say: "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger: but if ye turn away he is only responsible for the duty ,placed on him and ye for that placed on you. If ye obey him ye shall be on right guidance. The Messenger´s duty is only to preach the clear (Message).,Gangan:"Yea mitu Soko ye mae la mie tu Tuci ama ga bea zunma zheta to yandondo ke ta etiuboa sai de yanna aga la tau na.

Surah 24:55     ,                                Allah has promised to those among you who believe and work righteous deeds that He will of a surety grant them in the land inheritance (of power) as He granted it to those before them; that He will establish in authority their religion - the one which He has chosen for them; and that He will change (their state) after the fear in which they (lived) to one of security and peace: ´They will worship Me (alone) and not associate aught with Me. ´If any do reject Faith after this they are rebellious and wicked.,Zanazhi ga imani jin aci lo tun wangi-wangizhi mini yebo na Soko jin'a alkawali kedeU-ga'a ya kagbo (yan mulki) ta eti kinbo kendoe Ula kagbo yan mulki ya zanazhi shia dzo na.

Surah 24:57        ,  Never think thou that the Unbelievers are going to frustrate (Allah´s Plan) on earth: their abode is the Fire- and it is indeed an evil refuge!,Ye mae ga kpaye gan zanazhie jin kafirinci na aga'a gangwa kinbo ma. Ezhe keba'a mayi ena zoba ma'abi ye.
Surah 24:58 ,                                               O ye who believe! let those whom your right hands possess and the (children) among you who have not come of age ask your permission (before they come to your presence) on three occasions: before morning prayer; the while ye doff your clothes for the noonday heat; and after the late-night prayer: these are your three times of undress: outside those times it is not wrong for you or for them to move about attending to each other: Thus does Allah make clear the Signs to you: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 24:60        ,              Such elderly women as are past the prospect of marriage- there is no blame on them if they lay aside their (outer) garments provided they make not a wanton display of their beauty: but it is best for them to be modest: and Allah is One Who sees and knows all things.,Zanazhi ma'a kuku mini yinzagi yezhio na nazhi mae jin kauna yan yawo jin bea na lefi danboa na'ajin sauki eba ede dzua zhio naa ama'ade aga fe la ninpaazhi wu dan de boma ama ga wan miniadan be sutura jin'y wuncin de alheri ya'a gan.

Surah 24:63                 ,         Deem not the summons of the Messenger among yourselves like the summons of one of you to another: Allah doth know those of you who slip away under shelter of some excuse: then let those beware who withstand the Messenger´s order lest some trial befall them or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them.,E ga la yi-yi (eye-yi) yan Tuci (Soko) tsakaniebo be dozhi dozhi yi yi yetso be dozhi'I ma.

Surah 25:2      ,            He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: no son has He begotten nor has He a partner in His dominion: it is He who created all things and ordered them in due proportions.,Etsu na wun mulki sanmazhi to kin na Uma de egi ndondoa Uma de ema-paci dan mini mulkiUboa.

Surah 25:4  ,             But the misbelievers say: "Naught is this but a lie which he has forged and others have helped him at it."

Surah 26:227 ,                 Except those who believe work righteousness engage much in the remembrance of Allah and defend themselves only after they are unjustly attacked And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take!Sai de zanazhi ga imani jin na acie lo tun wangiwangizhi na aci tun Soko ye dokun aci wa taimako Soko eti jinjin gao baaci na aajin zwalunci na Bele yin ma zanazhi jin zwalunci na aa be kpe iri ezhe keba nagaayi ezhekebaa na

Surah 29:38        ,       (Remember also) the ´Ad and the Thamud (people): clearly will appear to you from (the traces) of their buildings (their fate): the Evil One made their deeds alluring to them and kept them back from the Path though they were gifted with intelligence and skill.,To jamaa yan Aduzhi to Samuduzhi (kpata Yiajin hallaka -- gan'anin) alama yan azabazhi ma'atula dan mini edunfe bazhio ya ye shaitan cia etun sakpazhi la apanin fia u cia pan ke eko Soko lugwa a tso ma yi be hankali.
Surah 29:38 ,              (Remember also) the ´Ad and the Thamud (people): clearly will appear to you from (the traces) of their buildings (their fate): the Evil One made their deeds alluring to them and kept them back from the Path though they were gifted with intelligence and skill.,To jamaa yan Aduzhi to Samuduzhi (kpata Yiajin hallaka -- gan'anin) alama yan azabazhi ma'atula dan mini edunfe bazhio ya ye shaitan cia etun sakpazhi la apanin fia u cia pan ke eko Soko lugwa a tso ma yi be hankali.
Surah 29:39 ,           (Remember also) Qarun Pharaoh and Haman: there came to them Moses with Clear Signs but they behaved with insolence on the earth; yet they could not overreach (Us).,To Qaruna (nan yi be ewo tsaba nande lisafia nan) to Fir'awna (nan fe ti binakun dan mulki u bonan) to Hamana (nan yi waziri Fir'awna eti binakun tio nan) (kpaata Yi a jin hallaka -- gan'anin) akika Annabi Musa la bayanizhi be ya a cia gbo tika kpeti kin bo akika a gan Soko gwa woa.
Surah 29:40      ,      Each one of them We seized for his crime: of them against some We sent a violent tornado (with showers of stones); some were caught by a (mighty) Blast; some We caused the earth to swallow up; and some We drowned (in the waters): It was not Allah Who injured (or oppressed) them:" They injured (and oppressed) their own souls.,Ebo a cin'o Yi a zaeni ndondoa wan be leifi u yin mini a bo a de nan zhi kabara ga jin'a hallakao nan mini a bo ade nanzhi Yi a kpe fi kin bo nan a ma de mini'abo nanzhi Yi gbin'a fi nuwan'o nan.

Surah 29:41                  The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of the spider who builds (to itself) a house; but truly the flimsiest of houses is the spider´s house;- if they but knew.,Kotonci yan za nanzhi a zandocizhi ko yandocizhi la tsocizhi ke Soko lugwa nan U yi ke kotonci yan Yedzu-yedzu naa' yandoci tu ci gan emi nan akika emi nan tso to gbogun gan mini emizhio nan U'ga yi emi yedzuyedzu o.da aci gan ade kpikpe de na.

Surah 29:44 ,        Allah created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): verily in that is a Sign for those who believe.,Soko a alitta yan sanmazhi to kin jin be (tsunwan) gaskiyae akika mini wuncin'o sinsantu yan zankpe Soko dan-bo ya za nanzhi yi Muminizhi nan.
Surah 29:45    ,                Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee and establish regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of Allah is the greatest (thing in life) without doubt. And Allah knows the (deeds) that ye do.,(Ya wye Annabi) Fegba yannazhi a jin wahayi'azhi be ya wye fi mini litafio nan wo maola sallah'o kuo gikini akika sallah wun'e kan gwa' etun zunyesunzhi to etun swakwazhi akikama pipa yan Soko wun'a gbota gan yandondo (mini bautao) Soko ma U yi be kpikpe yannazhi ye jin nan.
Surah 29:46     ,                   And dispute ye not with the People of the Book except with means better (than mere disputation) unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): but say "We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our Allah and your Allah is one; and it is to Him we bow (in Islam).",Ye mae ga fe gbo'mi be 'za ba litafizhi' ma sai de be eza nan gye gan nan sai dai nanzhi ga'fe binakun ticizhi nan (acie yiba ba ye nan) ye mae gan gan: "Yi'a imani jin be yan nan acin be ya yi nan (uga yi ALKUR'ANU'O) be yan nan acin be ya ye nan (litafi atawra to linjila) Tsoci yi ma to Tsoci ye nini'u yio yi ma kpatsun ta ya foro Soko.
Surah 29:47         ,         And thus (it is) that We have sent down the Book to thee. So the People of the Book believe therein as also do some of these (pagan Arabs): and none but Unbelievers reject our signs.,Acin ga ga u yio Yi cin litafi be' ya wyoe za nanzhi yi la litafi ya nan e ya gaskiya be u yin to mini za nnanzhio (jama'a yan al'umma nnanzhi) a de na gaskiya ya be'u yin nan a de za naa gbomi be aya yi zhi'i naa.

Surah 29:48     ,       And thou wast not (able) to recite a Book before this (Book came) nor art thou (able) to transcribe it with thy right hand: In that case indeed would the talkers of vanities have doubted.,Wyo ma fe za na e gba litafi ndondo shidzo kafi Alkur'anu naa wo ma fe 'za na e ka yan be gwalo'wyo yin naa ka can'a eza dedezhi a fe jin kelokezhin (eti Alkur'anuo).
Surah 29:49    ,         Nay here are Signs self-evident in the hearts of those endowed with knowledge: and none but the unjust reject Our Signs.,(Alkur'anu) Ujin eyan kelokezhin'a Alkur'anu ayazhi a yio nanzhi'a tu'la dan mini yangban 'za nanzhi (Soko) la kpikpe ya nan. Zae ni ndondo mae gbomi be aya Yizhi yin'a sai dai azwalumizhi.
Surah 29:50       ,        Ye they say: "Why are not Signs sent down to him from his Lord" Say: "The signs are indeed with Allah: and I am indeed a clear Warner.",A (kafirizhi) ci gan Kii'la a ci cin ayazhi nanzhi e wu gwa zankpezhi nan be ya'u dagan nko yan Tsoci'u boa yin'o" Gan ya gan: Aya yan egwa wu wuncinzhi eba Soko bo'a dan'o Mi'i man mi fe'a sai dai gangba jin ci nan tso a tula nan.
Surah 29:51      ,        And is it not enough for them that we have sent down to thee the Book which is rehearsed to them Verily in it is Mercy and a Reminder to those who believe.,Asha U kunke yaa nan Mi' a litafi cin be a ya 2wyoe acie gba'u yaa kando-kando e naa.

Surah 29:52      ,            Say: "Enough is Allah for a witness between me and you: He knows what is in the heavens and on earth.

Surah 29:53 ,          They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment (for them): had it not been for a term (of respite) appointed the Punishment would certainly have come to them: and it will certainly reach them- of a sudden while they perceive not!,A maa jin a fe din wyo ye be bibe yan azabae ka'u jin ebo eka nan Soko a yan'u ba cici a ni na'a da azaba ada be tsun'a akika ma azaba a be be ya a be girkui lokaci nan a tu sanwo wun'a nan.
Surah 29:54   ,  They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment: but of a surety Hell will encompass the Rejecters of Faith!-,E'din wyo ye be bibe yan azabae akika ma ena yan jahannama uga ma kafirizhi kezhe.
Surah 29:55      ,      On the Day that the Punishment shall cover them from above them and from below them and (a Voice) shall say: "Taste ye (the fruits) of your deeds!",Efo wuncin azaba ga rukpe'a dagan titabo da bici takoazhi Malaikazhi cia gan ya' gan: efe fin azaba yan etun dede nanzhi ye fe lo (izheo nan).

Surah 29:58   ,             But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness - to them shall We give a Home in Heaven- lofty mansions beneath which flow rivers- to dwell therein for aye;- an excellent reward for those who do (good)!-,Za' nan zhi ga imani jin a cie lo tun wangizhi nan.

Surah 29:60  ,         How many are the creatures that carry not their own sustenance It is Allah who feeds (both) them and you: for He hears and knows (all things).,Dokun dokun yan dabbazhi ujin atso e la kara gigiazhia Soko ga yi Etsu nan'e yaa gi nan'o to ye tso (zawangizhi) Soko gae kpa yeo Soko Etsu' u yio na'e wo esansan yandondo nan U ma yi be kpikpe yandondoe.
Surah 29:61    ,        If indeed thou ask them who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law) they will certainly reply "Allah". How are they then deluded away (from the truth),Wyo ma ga gbin'a gan gan: Zi'i jin sanmazhio to kin yin'o zi'i ma jin foro yan igidi to etswao A' gan gan: "Soko" Kici be la acie la ankali yezhi pan ya ke wunwun yan Soko lugwao
Surah 29:62    ,         Allah enlarges the sustenance (which He gives) to whichever of His servants He pleases; and He (similarly) grants by (strict) measure (as He pleases): for Allah has full knowledge of all things.,Soko gae la arziki a ya zae ga ba'u nan mini wuzhi'uuzhi bo u mae kezhe la arziki a yiku ya zana a ba u nan akika Soko de kpikpe yan hali ndondo (nan -- zandondo yin nan).
Surah 29:63    ,                 And if indeed thou ask them who it is that sends down rain from the sky and gives life therewith to the earth after its death they will certainly reply "Allah!" Say "Praise be to Allah!" But most of them understand not.,Akika wyo ga gbin'a gan gan: Zi yiza nae du ele zhin dagan sanma'o nan'o U ci kezhea kin dan rayi baci nan u yi eyan tsutsuci nan'o Akika a gan gan: " Soko'o "Gan gan yebo kpaata jin tabbata ya Soko.

Surah 29:64    ,          What is the life of this world but amusement and play but verily the Home in the Hereafter- that is life indeed if they but knew.,Edunfe izhe nanan u yi yandoa sai de eyan shagala be edzoe akika eku batsozhi u ga yi edunfeba yan eman rayi wangio da' aci gan a de kpikpe de nan.
Surah 29:65      ,         Now if they embark on a boat they call on Allah making their devotion sincerely (and exclusively) to Him; but when He has delivered them safely to (dry) land behold they give a share (of their worship to others)!-,Abeke zawangizhi ga' gandan mini eya nuwan'o nan a fe ti lali kpe Soko a adua be bautae tadzu (ya ninimbo yan Soko) be jinjin adini ka minan U gaa wa'dzun a cia pa tu lafiya nan a a fe za nanazhi e la yan a pa Soko baci nan.
Surah 29:66 ,    Disdaining ungratefully Our gifts and giving themselves up to (worldly) enjoyment!

Surah 29:67 ,             Do they not then see that We have made a sanctuary secure and that men are being snatched away from all around them Then do they believe in that which is vain and reject the Grace of Allah,Kashi a le'ba ye lea kendoe Yi yia Harami (Maka) laa fe ezhi yan aminci naa Ezhi nanzhi ma maa -- ba nan zawangizhi e wu dozhi wu fi bo naa Kashi ganmanan ga ye ajin imani be yin'o ye cie cin manan bo be eyan emanzhi nan Soko la a ya ye nan
Surah 29:68,                And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects the Truth when it reaches him Is there not a home in Hell for those who reject Faith,Zi'i ma gafe binakun tici gan za nan'e tswa ganmanna ta Soko nan'o ko ma wun'a gaskiya yi ganmannan lokaci nan gaskiya be ya'u nan'o Asha ecin ba (yan azaba) udan jahannamao ya kafirizhia
Surah 29:69  ,      And those who strive in Our (cause)- We will certainly guide them to our Paths: For verily Allah is with those who do right.,Za nanzhii ma a ga jin kokari eti wiwa yan yarda Mi Soko nan akika Mi ga' la a'ke eko Mi zhi akika taimako Soko u dan be za nanzhi e jin bolobolo (dan edunfe izheabo) nan:

Surah 3:3 ,         It is He Who sent down to thee (step by step) in truth the Book confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this as a guide to mankind and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong).,Wyun'a Litafi cin be'a ya wyoe ganni be gaskiyae umae la gaskiya-bo yan (litafi) nazhi shiu dzo na wu Uma cin Attaura be to Injeela.
Surah 3:4   ,              Then those who reject Faith in the Signs of Allah will suffer the severest penalty and Allah is Exalted in Might Lord of Retribution.,Shidzo batsozhio bawu a yio ya zawangizhi u ma cin (Funruqanu) Litafi na la erikpe dan tsakani gaskiya be ganmanae na Akika zanazhia jin kafirinci be aya Soko zhiy na azaba na gbota na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.

Surah 3:7   ,                                          He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning); they are the foundation of the Book: others are allegorical. But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical seeking discord and searching for its hidden meanings but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: "We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord:" and none will grasp the Message except men of understanding.,Wyun ga cin litafi be ya wyo yo miniu bo ayazhi danbo nazhi bayani hukunciazhi yi bibaci na a ga dokun gan fi litafi bo ndocizhi madanbo bayani hukuncizhi be dozhi.

Surah 3:10  ,            Those who reject Faith- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah: They are themselves but fuel for the Fire.,Akika za na zhia jin kafirinci na dukiya'azhi to egiazhi a kunke ya'a wo be yandondoe eba Soko boa a wuncinzhima agayi emi (be cigbantun) yan ena zhio.
Surah 3:11 ,            (Their plight will be) no better than that of the people of Pharaoh and their predecessors: They denied our Signs and Allah called them to account for their sins.

Such are the possessions of this world´s life; but in nearness to Allah is the best of the goals (To return to).,A wiwa yan eyan shahawazhi pa nini fi zawangizhi yan yinzagizhi egizhi to dukiya nazhi yi epa epazhi yan zinariya be azarfae na to doko nazhia pa nin na to dabbazhi to yangici sunsunzhi.

Surah 3:19  ,                       The Religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His Will): Nor did the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other after knowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of Allah Allah is swift in calling to account.,Akika adini (eko izhe le) natso Soko jin yeda be yin na U'gayi Musuluncio Za nazhi ma ala litafi ya na ace leba'a saibaci na ilimi da be ya na ebo yangban dede na dan tsakani'abo naZandondo na gae jin kafirinci be aya Soko zhi-na to akika Soko faneba hisabi jin'o.

Surah 3:77,                          As for those who sell the faith they owe to Allah and their own plighted word for a small price they shall have no portion in the Hereafter: Nor will Allah (Deign to) speak to them or look at them on the Day of Judgment nor will He cleans them (of sin): They shall have a grievous penalty.Akika za nazhi-eda shi eyan tetengi izhe be alkawali Sokoe na gan-gani be kutizhia zhi -na zawuncinzhi ade robo ndondo ya'a ekuboa Soko ma'a gangan bea yin'a U ma' cin'ale (be eye yegun'y) efo Alkiyami yin'a uma'a li'a' Azaba na ma tan na ga ji tabbata ya'a.
Surah 3:78,                           There is among them a section who distort the Book with their tongues: (As they read) you would think it is a part of the Book but it is no part of the Book; and they say "That is from Allah" but it is not from Allah: It is they who tell a lie against Allah and (well) they know it,Akika amade jama'a ndocizhi dan miniabo ajin afe zhe gintara gba dan bayani Litafio ebo de ye'fe kpaye ke de (bayani yan etun yangban wuncin)dagan Litafi ga bo u fe beo na alali ma ujin dagan Litafi ga boa. Ama'fe gan gan: (Egan) wuncin dagan eba Soko bo u fe beo alali ma ujin eba Soko bo ufe beo. Acie zun ganmana ta Soko atso ma kpe.
Surah 3:79 ,                          It is not (possible) that a man to whom is given the Book and Wisdom and the prophetic office should say to people: "Be ye my worshippers rather than Allah´s": on the contrary (He would say) "Be ye worshippers of Him Who is truly the Cherisher of all: For ye have taught the Book and ye have studied it earnestly.",Ugwo-yin ya zawangia ebo na Soko'a litafi to hukunci to Annabci la'a yau na gancin uciu feu gan'u ya zawangizhi gan: "Yeazhe wuzhizhi ya mi ke Soko lugwa'a Amma na gwoyin wyun'a gan nagayi yea fe eza bawta Soko zhi be iri ilimi nazhi ye de fi litafio na to kaatun nazhi ye'jin na.
Surah 3:80,            Nor would he instruct you to take angels and prophets for Lords and patrons. What! would he bid you to unbelief after ye have bowed your will (To Allah in Islam),Uma jin ye umurni gan ye dae la malaikazhi to Annabizhi ela Tsoci zhia. Kashi wyun'a jin ye umurni jin gan ye'laejin kafirinci baci na ye yeazhe musulumizhia ni na.
Surah 3:81,                                Behold! Allah took the covenant of the prophets saying: "I give you a Book and Wisdom; then comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you; do ye believe in him and render him help." Allah said: "Do ye agree and take this my Covenant as binding on you" They said: "We agree." He said: "Then bear witness and I am with you among the witnesses."(Wyo mao pa) Kamina Soko la alkawali be Annabizhi na (uci gan:) Mima litafi la'ayaye be hikimae gancin Tuci ci be yaye wyun'e ya gaskiya be yan na dan be ye yin na.

Surah 3:82,      If any turn back after this they are perverted transgressors,Zana zhi-ma ga zuma zheta baci wuncin'o na za wuncinzhi ga yi fasikizhio.
Surah 3:83,             Do they seek for other than the Religion of Allah-while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have willing or unwilling bowed to His Will (Accepted Islam) and to Him shall they all be brought back,Kashi adini ndoci ke yan Soko lugwa gae wa zao Alali ma zandondo na fi samazhio to kinbo na Soko gaata kpatsun yao eti banbao to eti kpakao E ba U gabo ma aku zawangizhi zheban lo'.
Surah 3:84,                            Say: "We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham Isma´il Isaac Jacob and the Tribes and in (the Books) given to Moses Jesus and the prophets from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them and to Allah do we bow our will (in Islam).",Gan gan: Yi yia imani jin be Sokoe be yan na a cin be ya yina be yana acin be ya Ibrahimae na to Ismaila to Ishaqa to Yakuba to Yagizhi na. To yan na a la ya Musa na to Isa to Annabawazhi dagan eba Tsociabo na. Yi ma la erikpe ndondo dan tsakaniaboa Yi ma'afe za nazhia kpatsun ta ya Soko na.
Surah 3:85,            If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah) never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good),Zandondo na ma gada wa ndoci yan Musulunci cigan adini na to a gwo gwa'uboa za wuncin ma ga'afe Efo Alkiyamio dan mini zanazhia jin asara nao.
Surah 3:86,                 How shall Allah Guide those who reject Faith after they accepted it and bore witness that the Messenger was true and that Clear Signs had come unto them but Allah guides not a people unjust,Ke wun'a zhe zhe na Soko ga bawu la'aya jama'a nazhi ajin kafirinci be sokoe baci na a imani jin be Sokoe nao. A tso ma eri jin ke Tuci (Soko) gaskiya uyio nao hujjazhi ma da be ya'a. Soko mae la jam'a yan Azwalumizhi kr ekoa.
Surah 3:87,        Of such the reward is that on them (rests) the curse of Allah of His angels and of all mankind,Zawuncinzhi egagba'a ugayi akika la'ana yan Soko ta etiabo to yan Malaikazhi to yan zawangizhi bae nio.
Surah 3:88,        In that will they dwell; nor will their penalty be lightened nor respite be (their lot);,Ama'fi bo fi tutun yin a'jin sauki azaba ya'a a ma pata ya'a.
Surah 3:89,          Except for those that repent (Even) after that and make amends; for verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Sai de za na zhi ga tuba jin zuma wuncin'o na acia gyara jin na to akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 3:89 ,         Except for those that repent (Even) after that and make amends; for verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Sai de za na zhi ga tuba jin zuma wuncin'o na acia gyara jin na to akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 3:90 ,            But those who reject Faith after they accepted it and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith- never will their repentance be accepted; for they are those who have (of set purpose) gone astray,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci baci yan imania bo na gancin acie be be eti kafirincio na a'gwo tuba'a za wuncinzhima aga yi eza egbinzhio.
Surah 3:91,                       As to those who reject Faith and die rejecting- never would be accepted from any such as much gold as the earth contains though they should offer it for ransom. For such is (in store) a penalty grievous and they will find no helpers,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci na har acia tsu alalima kafirizhi ayio na a'gwo ewo zinari naashe izhe na dagan egwa zaeni ndondo miniabo ka aga ga ewo wuncin la'asa etia a'gwo egwa'a boa. Zawuncizhima azaba na tan na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a ama'de za nazhia jin'a taimako na'a.
Surah 3:92 ,             By no means shall ye attain righteousness unless ye give (freely) of that which ye love; and whatever ye give of a truth Allah knoweth it well,Ye gade daraja yan bolobolo jin'a sai ye ga wu dukiyaye (dan eko Soko) mini yan nazhi yetso gae wa na yandondo na ma ye ga wu na akika Soko yi be kpikpe'u yin.
Surah 3:93,                       All food was lawful to the Children of Israel except what Israel Made unlawful for itself before the Law (of Moses) was revealed. Say: "Bring ye the Law and study it if ye be men of truth.",Yangici kpata halali ayio ya Banu Israilazhio sai de na Israiluzhi ga'a la jin haramu ya eti tacin'a shidzo bedzo kafi acin Ataura be na Gan-gan: " Ela Attaura beyn ye mae gbau wun'a yi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na.
Surah 3:94,          If any after this invent a lie and attribute it to Allah they are indeed unjust wrong-doers,Zandondo na gae tswa ganmana ta Soko na baci wuncin'o na to zawuncinzhi ga yi azwalumizhio.
Surah 3:95,          Say: "Allah speaketh the Truth: follow the religion of Abraham the sane in faith; he was not of the Pagans.",Gan gan: Soko'a gaskiya ta gancin ye mae la mie tu ekpa yan Ibrahima na'pan ke ganmana lugwa na uma fe dan mini za nazhie la yandoci pa Soko baci na'a.       
 Surah 3:97  ,                      In it are Signs Manifest; (for example) the Station of Abraham; whoever enters it attains security; Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to Allah- those who can afford the journey; but if any deny faith Allah stands not in need of any of His creatures,Mini ubo ayazhi danbo nazhia tula na (ke) kinigiba yan Ibrahima na.

Surah 3:98 ,          Say: "O People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of Allah when Allah is Himself witness to all ye do",Gan gan: Ya ye zaba litafizhi! Ki'la ye cie jin kafirinci be aya Soko yin'o Soko ma Eriko uyio ta eti etun nazhi ye ye lo na bo.
Surah 3:99 ,                 Say: "O ye People of the Book! Why obstruct ye those who believe from the path of Allah Seeking to make it crooked while ye were yourselves witnesses (to Allah´s Covenant) but Allah is not unmindful of all that ye do.",Gan gan : "Ya ye zaba litafizhi! Ki'la ye cie kan zanazhia imani jin na eko Soko yn dao ye cie wa gan ye'la eko Sokoe lae zhe kinkanci yetso ma erizhi ye yio tati wuncin bo Soko ma yaye ke etun nazhi ye'lo na lugwa'a.
Surah 3:100 ,            O ye who believe! If ye listen to a faction among the People of the Book they would (indeed) render you apostates after ye have believed!,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ye ga emitu kansan ndocizhi mini yan za na nazhi ala litafi ya na aga ye la'azhe kafirizhi baci yan imani ye bo.
Surah 3:101,                And how would ye deny Faith while unto you are rehearsed the Signs of Allah and among you Lives the Messenger Whoever holds firmly to Allah will be shown a way that is straight.Ke ma wun'a yi yi yeci ga'ajin kafirinci nao alali ma e'gba aya yan Sokozhi ya ye Tuciu madan tacin'yebo. Za na ga wa tswitswa cia egwa fin be Sokoe na akika a zawunci wuba lo eko gboro'.
Surah 3:102,           O ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared and die not except in a state of Islam.Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! E sundan Soko be gaskiyae kendoe ugwo Soko yin na. Yemae ga lugwa ajali be la ye ma sai eti kpatsun ta wangi ya foro Soko.
Surah 3:102,           O ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared and die not except in a state of Islam,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! E sundan Soko be gaskiyae kendoe ugwo Soko yin na. Yemae ga lugwa ajali be la ye ma sai eti kpatsun ta wangi ya foro Soko.
Surah 3:103 ,                               And hold fast all together by the rope which Allah (stretches out for you) and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude Allah´s favour on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love so that by His Grace ye became brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire and He saved you from it. Thus doth Allah make His Signs clear to you: That ye may be guided,Ye mae la 'gwae sun egban yan Soko gbanyin baenio yemae ga kpe kpere kpere' ma. Yemae fe'pa mana-mana yan Soko na ta eti yebo na yan kamina ye yea fe makiri dozhi le Soko cia cin cin la'adan yangban yezhio gancin yecia tinba yeazhe yegidozhi be ni'ima Sokoena.

Surah 3:104 ,            Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity,Jama'a ndoci mini yebo alaa kuagikinia fea yi zawangizhia lo etun alheri a fe jin zazhi umurni be etun wangizhi ama'a fea kangwa yan etun dedezhi. Za wuncinzhi ma agayi eza robo zhio.
Surah 3:104 ,            Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity,Jama'a ndoci mini yebo alaa kuagikinia fea yi zawangizhia lo etun alheri a fe jin zazhi umurni be etun wangizhi ama'a fea kangwa yan etun dedezhi. Za wuncinzhi ma agayi eza robo zhio.
Surah 3:105,             Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall into disputations after receiving Clear Signs: For them is a dreadful penalty,Ye mae ga'a fe ke zanazhia kpe kpere kpere'na ma baci na bayanizhi da be ya'a ni na. za wuncinzhi ma azaba na wancin na wun'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 3:106 ,               On the Day when some faces will be (lit up with) white and some faces will be (in the gloom of) black: To those whose faces will be black (will be said): "Did ye reject Faith after accepting it Taste then the penalty for rejecting Faith.",E fo'na fuska zandocizhi gaafu bokun be haske na fuska yan zandocizhi maga'shi zhiko za nazhi-ma fuska'azhi gaashi zhiko na (a gbin'agan gan:) Beke ye yea jin kafirinci jin baci yan imani yebo na Ebo acin'o e fe fin azaba ebo yannazhi ye'jin yan kafirinci na.
Surah 3:107,         But those whose faces will be (lit with) white- they will be in (the light of) Allah´s mercy therein to dwell ,Amma'a za nazhi fuskazhi a fu bokun be haske'na za wuncinzhi gaafe fi mini yegun Soko ama'fi bo fi tutun yin.
Surah 3:108 ,         These are the Signs of Allah: We rehearse them to thee in Truth: And Allah means no injustice to any of His creatures,Wuncinzhiaya Soko Zhi ayio yi'e gb'agba ya wyoe be gaskiyae Soko mae kpa zwalunci be alittazhi yin'a.
Surah 3:109,          To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: To Him do all questions go back (for decision),Soko gama wun yannazhi fi samazhio nao to nazhi fi kinbo nao eba Soko ga ma alamari kpata' azheban lo'.
Surah 3:110  ,                    Ye are the best of peoples evolved for mankind enjoining what is right forbidding what is wrong and believing in Allah. If only the People of the Book had faith it were best for them: among them are some who have faith but most of them are perverted transgressors,Ye yea fe al'umma na de alheri gan na ala tinya ya zawangizhina ye'jin zazhi umurni be luilo etun wangi' ye mae kan etun na gyea na ye mae jin imani be Sokoe.

Surah 3:111,          They will do you no harm barring a trifling annoyance; if they come out to fight you they will show you their backs and no help shall they get,Ajin ye gun woa sai de yan yangban yin. Ama ga'gun ye kun aga zuma'zhi zheta ye gancin ma ade zando jin'a taimakoa.

Surah 3:112 ,                                 Shame is pitched over them (Like a tent) wherever they are found except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah and from men; they draw on themselves wrath from Allah and pitched over them is (the tent of) destitution. This because they rejected the Signs of Allah and slew the prophets in defiance of right; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds,A egba be zunye sun'y wu kpea etio bandondo na aga tsoa gwa na sai de be alkawali na gboka na dagan eba Soko be alkawali dagan eba zawangizhio. Ama zheban be 'wunzhe dagan eba Soko acia ya ji wu ba'a etio. Wuncin ma yi akika ebo na afe zanazhie jin kafirinci be aya Soko zhi'ina ama fe'wu Annabi (Soko) zhi umayi be haki ndondo yin'a.

Surah 3:113,             Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of Allah all night long and they prostrate themselves in adoration,Ajin ye'nia dagan mini zaba litafizhioade jama'a nazhia kugikini wangi-na e'gba aya Soko zhi dan mini lokaci yan yeshio ama fe za nazhie dokun be sujada jin'y na.
Surah 3:114 ,             They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous,E'la imani jin be Sokoe to be Efo zobae a mae jin zazhi foro be etun wangizhiamae kangwa yan etun dedezhiamae dinye dan luilo yan etun alherizhio. Zawuncinzhi ma a fe dan mini za guruzhio.
Surah 3:115,        Of the good that they do nothing will be rejected of them; for Allah knoweth well those that do right,Etun ndondo na ma aga lo yan alheri na a la egagba'u a kan'a'a Soko ma yi be kpikpe yan za nazhie sundan soko na.
Surah 3:116,                 Those who reject Faith- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah: They will be companions of the Fire-dwelling therein (for ever),Akika za nzhia jin kafirinci na dukiya'azhi to egiazhi a kunke ya'a wo be yandondoe dagan eba Sokooa. Zawuncinzhi ma a gayi egi mi'na zhio.
Surah 3:117 ,                     What they spend in the life of this (material) world May be likened to a wind which brings a nipping frost: It strikes and destroys the harvest of men who have wronged their own souls: it is not Allah that hath wronged them but they wrong themselves,Kotonci yan dukiya nae wu dan mini edunfe izhe nanao na u yi ke kotonci efe na yeko fu dan nin yan'ubo na uci da tswan yandzo yan jama'a ndoci nazhia etitancin'a jin zwalunci na uci'ujin hallaka Soko ma jin'a zwaluncia amma'ade eti tacin'a tso gae jin zwaluncio.
Surah 3:118 ,                            O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks: They will not fail to corrupt you. They only desire your ruin: Rank hatred has already appeared from their mouths: What their hearts conceal is far worse. We have made plain to you the Signs if ye have wisdom.Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega da da eya yan asiri be zandocizhi na jin zaba imania na ma a cinta ya ye be egun jin yin'a.

Surah 3:119 ,                         Ah! ye are those who love them but they love you not- though ye believe in the whole of the Book. When they meet you they say "We believe": But when they are alone they bite off the very tips of their fingers at you in their rage. Say: "Perish in you rage; Allah knoweth well all the secrets of the heart.",Ye'ga dan nao Ye ye' wa'a a mae wa ye yea. Ye ma gan yea imani jin be litafiy bae nio.

Surah 3:120 ,                   If aught that is good befalls you it grieves them; but if some misfortune overtakes you they rejoice at it. But if ye are constant and do right not the least harm will their cunning do to you; for Allah Compasseth round about all that they do,Kamina alheri ndoci ga'ade ye na wun'ela yangban'azhia yin egun ndoci ma ga'a tswanye ajin afe fa yangban be wunci'y.

Surah 3:121,          Remember that morning Thou didst leave Thy household (early) to post the faithful at their stations for battle: And Allah heareth and knoweth all things,(Wyo mao pa) Na wyo saka tinya dagan eba iyali wyozhio na wyo cie la Muminizhi shishi dan dannazhio ebo ekun'o na Soko ma Etsu nae wo yandondo na uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio. 
Surah 3:122,           Remember two of your parties Meditated cowardice; but Allah was their protector and in Allah should the faithful (Ever) put their trust,(Wyo mao pa ) Kamina jama'a yan ena guba mini ye bo akpa gan a ga to gbogun na (aga zuma ya ) Soko ga mayi Ndakata zaguba'abao ebo acin'o Muminizhi de a la'a kpea tswo soko. 
Surah 3:123 ,        Allah had helped you at Badr when ye were a contemptible little force; then fear Allah; thus May ye show your gratitude.,Akika ma Soko jin ye taimako dan ekun yan Badaruo kanga a ye yi gbogun ebo acin'o e sundan Soko ujin wo be wuncin'y ye ga'fe za nazhie jin ye bo ya Soko na. 
Surah 3:124 ,           Remember thou saidst to the Faithful: "Is it not enough for you that Allah should help you with three thousand angels (Specially) sent downKamina wyo fe gan gan be Muminizhi na Asha U kunye kea na Tsoci ye ajin ye taimako be malaikazhi kputsun'utsun eda guta nazhia fe cinbe dagan samao naa 
Surah 3:125,              "Yea - if ye remain firm and act aright even if the enemy should rush here on you in hot haste your Lord would help you with five thousand angels Making a terrific onslaught,Acinga gao akika ye ga akuri jin ye cie sundan Soko kada makirizhi ga be dzun fi ye be girikuy iri nanae Tsoci ye ajin'e taimako be malaika kpautsun'tsun har eda gutsun zhi nazhi ma'ayi be alamazhi na. 
Surah 3:126  ,              Allah made it but a message of hope for you and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from Allah. The Exalted the Wise,Soko ma la wuncin la'afea sai de ebo ula'uzhe bushara'u yaye ebo ma yangban yezhia la'ashi beuyin. Taimako ma wun'e fea sai de dagan eba Soko Etsu na yi Etsu zankpe na Umayi Etsu hikima na.
 Surah 3:127,        That He might cut off a fringe of the Unbelievers or expose them to infamy and they should then be turned back frustrated of their purpose.Ebo wyun'ula kansan ndoci yan kafirizhi'u zun koma wyun'u la'au sunzunye har atsoa la'a zheban ala'afe eza zunzunyacizhi. 
Surah 3:128,           Not for thee (but for Allah) is the decision: Whether He turn in mercy to them or punish them; for they are indeed wrong-doers,Wyode kagbo ndondo etiaboa (sai de wyo wu yan ) ko wun'aba Soko ugwo tuba na'jin na wyun'a ba Uma ujin'a azaba. Akika azwalumizhi ayio. 
Surah 3:129 ,             To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and punisheth whom He pleaseth; but Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Soko ga ma wun yannafi samazhio nao to nazhi fi kinbo nao wyun'e fa be za na ga bau na U mae jin za na ga bau na azaba Soko ma Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio. 
Surah 3:130 ,          O ye who believe! Devour not usury doubled and multiplied; but fear Allah; that ye may (really) prosper,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega gi riba ekpeba dozhi ta eti ekpeba dozhio maye mae sundan Soko ujin wo be wuncin'y ye ga 'atswo gurizhi. 
Surah 3:131 ,   Fear the Fire which is repaired for those who reject Faith,Ye mae tswa ena na Soko jin shiri ya kafirizhi na.
 Surah 3:132,    And obey Allah and the Messenger; that ye may obtain mercy,Ye mae la 'mie tu Soko be Tuci (Sokoe) ujinwo be wuncin'y a gun'e ye 
Surah 3:132,    And obey Allah and the Messenger; that ye may obtain mercy,Ye mae la 'mie tu Soko be Tuci (Sokoe) ujinwo be wuncin'y a gun'e ye 
Surah 3:133 ,         Be quick in the race for forgiveness from your Lord and for a Garden whose width is that (of the whole) of the heavens and of the earth prepared for the righteous,Ye mae dinye' dan wiwa yan gafarao dagan eba Tsoci yebo to Aljanna na epe'u yi ke samazhi be kin yin na.Ama jin shiri'ujin ya zana nazhie gae sundan Sokona. 
Surah 3:134,            Those who spend (freely) whether in prosperity or in adversity; who restrain anger and pardon (all) men;- for Allah loves those who do good;-Za nazhie wu dukiya'azhi (fi eko wangio) dan lokaci yan bagwo'ona to lokaci ba pin'yna to za nazhie jin guri acie la fushiazhi nyin na to za nazhie fa be le'fi zazhi-na Soko mae wa za nazhie jin bolobolo na. 
Surah 3:135 ,                    And those who having done something to be ashamed of or wronged their own souls earnestly bring Allah to mind and ask for forgiveness for their sins- and who can forgive sins except Allah- and are never obstinate in persisting knowingly in (the wrong) they have done,To za nazhi Kamina aga etun alfasha lo na ko ma acia eti tacin'a jin zwalunci na ajin apa Soko na gancin acie ba gafara yan zunubiazhi na. Zai ma danbo nae fa be zunubizhi-nao sai de Soko. Amae tu gikini ta eti etun le'fiazhi boa alali ma atso kpe wo gan ugye'a na'a. 
Surah 3:136 ,             For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath- an eternal dwelling: How excellent a recompense for those who work (and strive),Zawuncinzhi kpata egagba'a yi gafara dagan eba Tsociabo gan ni be emi Aljannazhi-nazhi nuwan eduzhie je fi tako''abo na. Baga bo ma'afi tutun yin'o. Madanla be egagba yan zanazhie lo 'tun wagi na. 
Surah 3:136,              For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath- an eternal dwelling: How excellent a recompense for those who work (and strive)!,Zawuncinzhi kpata egagba'a yi gafara dagan eba Tsociabo gan ni be emi Aljannazhi-nazhi nuwan eduzhie je fi tako''abo na. Baga bo ma'afi tutun yin'o. Madanla be egagba yan zanazhie lo 'tun wagi na.
 Surah 3:137 ,           Many were the Ways of Life that have passed away before you: travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth,Misali yan ekpa wangi wangizhi a shi ye dzo'ani ebo acin'o yetsoe dazn'efi mini kinbo gancin yecie cin'ele'lo iri kendoe zoba ganmana zuncizhizyi na.
 Surah 3:138,     Here is a plain statement to men a guidance and instruction to those who fear Allah!Nana bayani uyio ya zawangizhi u mayi bawu to wa'azi ya zanazhie sundan Soko na. 
Surah 3:139 ,      So lose not heart nor fall into despair: For ye must gain mastery if ye are true in Faith,Ye mae ga to gbogun ma Ye mae ga nyin yangban ma yegazhi yi za nazhi latu gan nao matuka ye de ga'afe Muminizhi na. 
Surah 3:140 ,                      If a wound hath touched you be sure a similar wound hath touched the others. Such days (of varying fortunes) We give to men and men by turns: that Allah may know those that believe and that He may take to Himself from your ranks Martyr-witnesses (to Truth). And Allah loveth not those that do wrong,E-ba-yin ndoci ga'ade ye eba yin iri wuncin de zandocizhi leani efo wuncizhi ma yi yiajin yi fe' san'ugwasan dan tsakani zawangizhio ebo soko udeba'u la kpikpe'u wu yan zanazhi ga jin imani (yan gaskiya na) Uma'ude za nazhiatsu tsutsu yan erizhi na dagan mini yebo. Soko mae wa azwalumizhia. 
Surah 3:141,    Allah´s object also is to purge those that are true in Faith and to deprive of blessing Those that resist Faith.Ebo ma ude ba'u la sinsan-wangi ula'udan za nazhia imani jin na (ke aibi kpata lugwa ) U ma'u la albarka'u wa'uya nakan kafirizhio. 
Surah 3:142 ,           Did ye think that ye would enter Heaven without Allah testing those of you who fought hard (In His Cause) and remained steadfast,Kashi ye' kpaye kpa gan ye ga de gandan Aljannao alali ma Soko la'la zanazhie ceko ya Soko mini yebo na wua Uma la'ala za nazhie jin hakuri na wu (be mima cinle yin'a). 
Surah 3:143,           Ye did indeed wish for death before ye met him: Now ye have seen him with your own eyes (And ye flinch!),Akika ma ye yea fe shidzo batso zhio ye fe jin guri yan ajali tun u la be de ye yea akika gbani ye yeu le yeani gancin yecei cin ba le. 
Surah 3:144,                          Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many Were the messenger that passed away before him. If he died or were slain will ye then Turn back on your heels If any did turn back on his heels not the least harm will he do to Allah; but Allah (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude.
Surah 3:145 ,                      Nor can a soul die except by Allah´s leave the term being fixed as by writing. If any do desire a reward in this life We shall give it to him; and if any do desire a reward in the Hereafter We shall give it to him. And swiftly shall We reward those that (serve us with) gratitude,Uma'a ye jin na rayi ndondo a tsu na'a sai de be izini Sokoe alkawali uyio na;adan kangi be ajali-na. Zandondo na ma gae kpa laada izhe (be etun'yn na) Yia la yau dagan miniubo zandondo na ma gae kpa laada yan Alkiyami na Yia la yau dagan miniubo. Bele'yin ma. Yia la egagba wangi ya zanazhi gae jin yeabo ya Soko na. 
Surah 3:146,                    How many of the prophets fought (in Allah´s way) and with them (fought) Large bands of godly men but they never lost heart if they met with disaster in Allah´s way nor did they weaken (in will) nor give in. And Allah Loves those who are firm and steadfast,Dokun dokun mini yan Annabizhio a gunkun dan eko Soko amayi be eza Soko zhi na dokun na nazhi pama bea yin na yangban'azhi ma nakin be iiri yannazhi tswan'a eti ekpa Soko na'a ama to gbogun'a ama ya tia. Soko mae de cincin yan za nazhie jin hakuri na.
 Surah 3:147,                  All that they said was: "Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and anything We may have done that transgressed our duty: Establish our feet firmly and help us against those that resist Faith.",E gan'a ma ufe'a sai de egan na'agan gan: "Tsoci yan yi! Fa be zunubi yizhiy to barna (eyan nyin) nazhi yi yin dan mini alamari yi zhio na wyo mao la bici kinpa yizhio kpe kin wangiy. Wyo mao jin yi taimako ta eti jama'a yan kafirizhio". 
Surah 3:148 ,        And Allah gave them a reward in this world and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For Allah Loveth those who do good,Soko ci ga'a gba laada yan izhe' ganni be bolobolo yan laada alkiyamiy. Soko mae wa za nazhi gae jin bolobolo na. 
Surah 3:149 ,          O ye who believe! If ye obey the Unbelievers they will drive you back on your heels and ye will turn back (from Faith) to your own loss.Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! yega 'mi tu za nazhi jin kafirinci na a ga ye la'a zheban da dandan yezhi gancin yeci ga'afe eza hasarazhi. 
Surah 3:150 ,    Nay Allah is your protector and He is the best of helpers,A'a Soko tsayi Ndakata yeyeo wyun ga ma dokun gan eba jinjin taimako bo. 
Surah 3:151,                  Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers for that they joined companions with Allah for which He had sent no authority: their abode will be the Fire: And evil is the home of the wrong-doers,Yi ga edo cedan yangban yan kafirizhio ebo eyan nazhie la pa Soko baci nao nama Soko cin hujja ndondo be tia boa na. Ezhe keba'a mayi ena. Bibi majin tabbata ya ecinba yan azwalumizhi. 
Surah 3:152 ,                                      Allah did indeed fulfil His promise to you when ye with His permission Were about to annihilate your enemy-until ye flinched and fell to disputing about the order and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight (of the booty) which ye covet. Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you but He forgave you: For Allah is full of grace to those who believe,Sokoa alkawali'U be ye yin she yaye be gaskiyae lokaci na ye fe'wu makiri yezhi be izini Sokoe na har da kamina ye bea gbakpan na yecife' gbo 'mi be dozhi eti umurni na'ala ya ye nao yecia le ba baci na Sokoa yan na ye' wa na la'awu ye na.

Soko ma Etsu falala uyio ya Muminizhi.
 Surah 3:153 ,                       Behold! ye were climbing up the high ground without even casting a side glance at any one and the Messenger in your rear was calling you back. There did Allah give you one distress after another by way of requital to teach you not to grieve for (the booty) that had escaped you and for (the ill) that had befallen you. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do,Kamina ye fe' gunta eti patio na yema zhe ka kansan cin zandondo lea alali ma Tuci Soko dan batsozhio cie ta 'mi yiye. Soko ci gae-gba be yangban- yin'y ta eti yangban yin'o ebo ye ga nyin yangban eti yan na'a fan ye gwa na mao. Ye mae ga nyin yangban eti yanna tswan ye na mao. Soko mayi be kpikpe yan etun nazhi ye' lo na. 
Surah 3:154       ,                                                                   After (the excitement) of the distress He sent down calm on a band of you overcome with slumber while another band was stirred to anxiety by their own feelings Moved by wrong suspicions of Allah-suspicions due to ignorance. They said: "What affair is this of ours" Say thou: "Indeed this affair is wholly Allah´s." They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee. They say (to themselves): "If we had had anything to do with this affair We should not have been in the slaughter here." Say: "Even if you had remained in your homes those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death"; but (all this was) that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts,Gancin Soko ci cin aminci bea yaye baci yangban nyin'o ugayi igbe tao na'a rukpe kansan ndoci ma miniabo shagala yan eti tacin'a wun'ajin shagala acie kpaye natso jin yan gaskiya'a na lo eba Soko iri yekpa yan (jahiliyazhi) eza rakpezhi.

Surah 3:155 ,                   Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts Met-it was Satan who caused them to fail because of some (evil) they had done. But Allah Has blotted out (their fault): For Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Forbearing.Akika za nazhi zhe zumata fo na jama'a gubaba keba na akika shetan tsa dan'akin yin'o ebo sashi woce dede (yan le'fi Soko) nae ce nao. Akika ma Soko fa bea yin. Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu hakuri uyio.
 Surah 3:156,                                   O ye who believe! Be not like the Unbelievers who say of their brethren when they are travelling through the Earth or engaged in fighting: "If they had stayed with us they would not have died or been slain." This that Allah may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is Allah that gives Life and Death and Allah sees well all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ye ga'afe ke za nazhia jin kafirici na ma nazhie gan ya yegiazhi kamina aga tinya dan ezan'o kinbo na ko ma aga dan eba ekun'o na: "Da'aci gan be yi yin adan'o da'a tsua a ma'a wu'a Nana ma (uyi) ebo Sokoula egan na'agan shidzo na ulaufe robonkpe'u ya'a fi mini yangban azhio. Soko gamae dan yan rayio wyun ga mae wu rayio. Soko mae cinye le be iri etun nazhi ye'lo nae. 
Surah 3:157  ,           And if ye are slain or die in the way of Allah forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than all they could amass.Akika ma ka aga ye wu dan eko Soko ko ma yecia tsu akika gafara dagan nko yan Soko be yegun'y ade alheri gan yan na zawangizhie kuyekan (izheo na). 
Surah 3:158      And if ye die or are slain Lo! it is unto Allah that ye are brought together.Kama yega'tsu ko ma acia ye wu akika eba Soko gabo'aku ye yekan zhio. 
Surah 3:159,                             It is part of the Mercy of Allah that thou dost deal gently with them Wert thou severe or harsh-hearted they would have broken away from about thee: so pass over (Their faults) and ask for (Allah´s) forgiveness for them; and consult them in affairs (of moment). Then when thou hast Taken a decision put thy trust in Allah. For Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him).Ebo yegun ndoci dagan eba Soko wyoe da cici ya' da wyo ga'fe za nae zhewun uma gboka yangban na da aga'ga- yan'aya dagan eba wyo bo.

Surah 3:160 ,                If Allah helps you none can overcome you: If He forsakes you who is there after that that can help you in Allah then Let believers put their trust.Soko ga ye jin taimako'ani zandondo danbo na'a zan yekpe be na'a  Uma ga'a dzungan'e bo to zi danbo na'ajin ye taimako zuma'Ubo nao Soko tsama Muminizhi yakpeo'.
 Surah 3:160,                 If Allah helps you none can overcome you: If He forsakes you who is there after that that can help you in Allah then Let believers put their trust.Soko ga ye jin taimako'ani zandondo danbo na'a zan yekpe be na'a  Uma ga'a dzungan'e bo to zi danbo na'ajin ye taimako zuma'Ubo nao Soko tsama Muminizhi yakpeo'. 
Surah 3:160 ,                If Allah helps you none can overcome you: If He forsakes you who is there after that that can help you in Allah then Let believers put their trust,Soko ga ye jin taimako'ani zandondo danbo na'a zan yekpe be na'a  Uma ga'a dzungan'e bo to zi danbo na'ajin ye taimako zuma'Ubo nao Soko tsama Muminizhi yakpeo'.
 Surah 3:161,                    No prophet could (ever) be false to his trust. If any person is so false He shall on the Day of Judgment restore what he misappropriated; then shall every soul receive its due- whatever it earned- and none shall be dealt with unjustly,Uma'a gwoyin na Annabi ndondo a yi eyan jama'azhi na'a. Zandondo na ga yi eyan jama'azhi na uga yan na uyi na la tinya Efo Alkiyami gancin acia wo rayi ndondo gbata be iri woce na uga ce na ama'a jin'a zwaluncia.
 Surah 3:162 ,           Is the man who follows the good pleasure of Allah Like the man who draws on himself the wrath of Allah and whose abode is in Hell- A woeful refuge!,Ngba za na emitu (etun) yan yedajin Soko na ugazhe ye'ni be za nae dingwa da wa ewunzhe yan Soko na ezhe kebau cia zhe jahannama na Bibi ma ajin tabbata ya ezhe keba wuncin. 
Surah 3:163,       They are in varying gardens in the sight of Allah and Allah sees well all that they do.A (wuncizhi) darajazhi ayio eba yan Soko bo. Soko mae cin'ale be iri etu nazhie lo na. 
Surah 3:164 ,                       Allah did confer a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a messenger from among themselves rehearsing unto them the Signs of Allah sanctifying them and instructing them in Scripture and Wisdom while before that they had been in manifest error,Akika Sokoa eryatwa wanciko la'aya Muminizhi ebo Tuci nau tun-tun fia daga miniatso' na ucie gba ayauzhi ya'a umae taadzu umae la ilimi yan litafi to hikimazhi wua. Ama'afe shidzo batsozhio dan mini egbin na'tula nao. 
Surah 3:165 ,                  What! When a single disaster smites you although ye smote (your enemies) with one twice as great do ye say- "Whence is this" Say (to them): "It is from yourselves: For Allah hath power over all things,"Kashi kamina ma mimacinle ndoci gaa tswan'ye na alali ma yetso la iri wuncin (guba) tswan zazhi lean-ye fe gan gan: Dagan babo nna fe beo Gan gan: "Dagan eba yetso bo ufe beo" Akika ma Soko de kagbo ta eti yandondo'. 
Surah 3:166,        What ye suffered on the day the two armies Met was with the leave of Allah in order that He might test the believers,Yan na na ma tswan ye fo na jama'a guba'ba keba na to be izini yan Soko yin'o. Ebo ma Soko ude ba'u la mumini yan gaskiyazhi'u tu (ebo'a kpea ye). 
Surah 3:167 ,                               And the Hypocrites also. These were told: "Come fight in the way of Allah or (at least) drive (The foe from your city)." They said: "Had we known how to fight we should certainly have followed you." They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal,Ebo ma' Ula munafikizhi'a tua la (ezazhia kpea'ye) ama ci gan'a gan: Edabe ye be gukun'edan eko Soko' ko ma ye'la makirizhie nyan'e tin'eya.

Surah 3:168,              (They are) the ones that say (of their brethren slain) while they themselves sit (at ease): "If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain." Say: "Avert death from your own selves if ye speak the truth.",Za nazhi- gan ya yegiazhi atso ma'afe dun na "Da aci gan a mi tu yi tu daa a wu'a Gan gan: Yetsoe la tsutsue dagwae ya'e eti tacin ye' yi wun'ayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na. 
Surah 3:168 ,             (They are) the ones that say (of their brethren slain) while they themselves sit (at ease): "If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain." Say: "Avert death from your own selves if ye speak the truth.",Za nazhi- gan ya yegiazhi atso ma'afe dun na "Da aci gan a mi tu yi tu daa a wu'a Gan gan: Yetsoe la tsutsue dagwae ya'e eti tacin ye' yi wun'ayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na. Surah 3:169            Think not of those who are slain in Allah´s way as dead. Nay they live finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord;Wyo mao ga kpaye gan za nazhiaga wu fi eko Soko'na a tsu ma. A'a ayi be rayia yin dan nko Tsocia bo e'ya'a arzikizhi gi. 
Surah 3:170,                  They rejoice in the bounty provided by Allah: And with regard to those left behind who have not yet joined them (in their bliss) the (Martyrs) glory in the fact that on them is no fear nor have they (cause to) grieve,Acie fa yangban be yan nazhi soko la ya'a mini eryatwa u zhio na a mae la bushara ya za nazhi la'abe tsun'a ya'a na mini nazhi dan zuma'abo na. Ke de' eyan dansun ndondo dan bo ya a ama'ale yangban yin ndondo yea.
 Surah 3:171,          They glory in the Grace and the bounty from Allah and in the fact that Allah suffereth not the reward of the Faithful to be lost (in the least),E'fa yangban be ni'imae dagan eba Soko' ganni be eryatwa uyin. Akika ma Sokoe ta la'ada yan etun Muminizhi yakpea. 
Surah 3:172  ,            Of those who answered the call of Allah and the Messenger even after being wounded those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward,Za nazhi ye yiyi yan Soko to Tuci'I na baci yan etin nazhi dea na. Egagba wanciko ma'ajin tabbata ya za nazhi gae jin bolobolo acie sundan Soko na. 
Surah 3:173,                Men said to them: "A great army is gathering against you": And frightened them: But it (only) increased their Faith: They said: "For us Allah sufficeth and He is the best disposer of affairs.",Za nazhi zawangizhi gan ya'a gan: Akika zawangizhia gun eti yebo ebo acin'o e sundan'a. wuncin na'agan na ci bea imani aci gan: Sokoa kunke ya yiyio madanla be Ndakatabo yan Sokoe. 
Surah 3:174,              And they returned with Grace and bounty from Allah: no harm ever touched them: For they followed the good pleasure of Allah: And Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded,Aci zheban da'a da be ni'imae dagan eba Soko ganni be eryatwae egun ndondo ma la'gwa toa acia emitu yan na Soko jin yeda beyin na. Soko ma Etsu ryatwa uyio na wancin na. 
Surah 3:175,          It is only the Evil One that suggests to you the fear of his votaries: Be ye not afraid of them but fear Me if ye have Faith,Akika wuncin de (egan) shetan tsa uyio na wyun'e la'ali masoyiuzhi dan na Ebo acin'o ega sundan'a ma esundan Mi wun'ayi Muminizhi ga ye yio na. 
Surah 3:176,                     Let not those grieve thee who rush headlong into Unbelief: Not the least harm will they do to Allah: Allah´s plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter but a severe punishment,Za nazhi-ma e'da din yin dan etun kafirincio na ga lugwa wuncin nyin wyoe yangban ma. Akika ajin Soko gun wo be yandondo yin'a. Sokoe kpa kpa gan wyun'a la robo ndondo ya'a efo Alkiyamia. Azaba na ma tan na wun'ajin tabbata ya'a. 
Surah 3:177,           Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith- not the least harm will they do to Allah but they will have a grievous punishment.Akika zanazhi da shi kafirinci be imani-na ajin Soko 'gun be yandondoe woa azaba na ma tan na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a. 
Surah 3:177 ,          Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith- not the least harm will they do to Allah but they will have a grievous punishment,Akika zanazhi da shi kafirinci be imani-na ajin Soko 'gun be yandondoe woa azaba na ma tan na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a. 
Surah 3:178 ,              Let not the Unbelievers think that our respite to them is good for themselves: We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity: But they will have a shameful punishment,Za nazhi- ma'ajin kafirici na a ga kpa ye kpa gan eta pa na yie la ya'a na alheri uyio ya rayiao ma. Akika Yie pata pa ya'a ebo ade ba'ade bibe yan le'fi jin azaba yan egba ma ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.
 Surah 3:179,                                   Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now until He separates what is evil from what is good nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen. But He chooses of His Messengers (For the purpose) whom He pleases. So believe in Allah. And His messengers: And if ye believe and do right ye have a reward without measure,U fe acin ya Sokoa na'Uga Muminizhi ya ta eti yanna ye kpe tiubo naa sai de uga erikpe la'adan tsakani eyan dedezhi kperi be eyan wangizhi.

Surah 3:180    ,                         And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which Allah Hath given them of His Grace think that it is good for them: Nay it will be the worse for them: soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied to their necks Like a twisted collar on the Day of Judgment. To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Za nazhi mae tan yanbo be yan na Soko la ya'a dagan mini falala ubo na a ga kpa ye gan alheri wun'ayi ya'ao ma.

Surah 3:180 ,                            And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which Allah Hath given them of His Grace think that it is good for them: Nay it will be the worse for them: soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied to their necks Like a twisted collar on the Day of Judgment. To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Za nazhi mae tan yanbo be yan na Soko la ya'a dagan mini falala ubo na a ga kpa ye gan alheri wun'ayi ya'ao ma.

 Surah 3:181 ,                    Allah hath heard the taunt of those who say: "Truly Allah is indigent and we are rich!"- We shall certainly record their word and (their act) of slaying the prophets in defiance of right and We shall say: "Taste ye the penalty of the Scorching Fire!,Akika Soko wo egan za nazhi gangan: "Akika Soko talaka uyio Yi ma eyandecizhi yiyio na" Yi ga yan na'agan na ka to wuwu ma'awu Annabizhi umayi be haki ndondo yin'a na. Yi cia gan gan: "Efe fin azaba ena dindinci". 
Surah 3:182,        "This is because of the (unrighteous deeds) which your hands sent on before ye: For Allah never harms those who serve Him.",Wuncin mayi ebo etun dede na egwa yetsozhi lashidzo nao. Akika ma Soko jin azwalumi lo eba wuzhi ndondoa. 
Surah 3:183  ,                         They (also) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in an messenger unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: why then did ye slay them if ye speak the truth",Za nazhi gan gan: "Akika Soko jin alkawali be yi yin gan yi-ga jin imani be Tuci ndondoe ma sai U ga be be dabba zunzunci na ena'afe giu na". Gan gan: Akika Tuicizhi be ya ye shi-midzo ganni be yanna ye gan nae ki-la yecia wuao wun'ayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio nao. 
Surah 3:184  ,         Then if they reject thee so were rejected messengers before thee who came with Clear Signs Books of dark prophecies and the Book of Enlightenment,A maga (egan) wyoe yi ganmana akika a yi egan Tuci nazhi shi wyo dzo na ganmana acin ga a ma be be hujjazhi be litafizhiy ama be be litafi na'ashe be haske'na. 
Surah 3:185 ,                     Every soul shall have a taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have attained the object (of Life): For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception,Rayi ndondo sai uga egwa ladan ajali da'a 'mi. Akika ma aga laada etun yezhi she yaye Efo Alkiyamiy.

Surah 3:186,                       Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and ye shall certainly Hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods. But if ye persevere patiently and guard against evil-then that will be a determining factor in all affairs,Akika a' mae cin le mini dukiyaezhio to rayiezhio akika ye m'a wo egan egunzhi dagan misun za nazhiala litafi ya shi ye dzo nao to eba za nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na egan egun na dokun na amma' ye ga hakuri jin yeci sundan Soko akika wuncin dan mini alamari nazhi wancin na. 
Surah 3:187,                    And remember Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book to make it known and clear to mankind and not to hide it; but they threw it away behind their backs and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made!,(Wyo mao pa) lokaci na Soko la alkawali be za nazhi a la litafi ya na kede akika yega'ujin bayani ya zawangizhi na ye mae ga swo'u ma Aci'u ceya ci zuma'abo aci da'a eyan tetengi izhe shi be'u yin.

 Surah 3:188          ,         Think not that those who exult in what they have brought about and love to be praised for what they have not done- think escape the penalty. For them is a penalty Grievous indeed.,Wyo mao ga kpaye gan zanazhie fa yangban be yan na a la laya za na a mae wa gan a jin yebo' aya'a be etun na ujin a loa na. Ega kpaye gan aga gangwa be azabae ma. Azaba na ma tan na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.

Surah 3:191 ,                   Men who celebrate the praises of Allah standing sitting and lying down on their sides and contemplate the (wonders of) creation in the heavens and the earth (With the thought): "Our Lord! not for naught Hast Thou created (all) this! Glory to Thee! Give us salvation from the penalty of the Fire,Za nazhie pa Soko gi gbaro' to edunfe bao to kamina aga'yaci cia kansan ya kin na acie kpaye wangi dan jin jin yan samazhio to kin na.

Surah 3:198 ,                   On the other hand for those who fear their Lord are Gardens with rivers flowing beneath; therein are they to dwell (for ever)- a gift from the presence of Allah; and that which is in the presence of Allah is the best (bliss) for the righteous,Ammaade za nazhie sundan Tsocia na ayibe egagba yan Aljannazhiy nazhi nuwan zhie je fi takoabo na. Bagabo afi tutun yin'o ecin ba uyio dagan eba Soko' yan nazhi-ma fi eba Soko- na de alheri gan ya eza kirkizhi.
 Surah 3:199 ,                            And there are certainly among the People of the Book those who believe in Allah in the revelation to you and in the revelation to them bowing in humility to Allah: They will not sell the Signs of Allah for a miserable gain! For them is a reward with their Lord and Allah is swift in account,Akika ma ade dan mini zaba litafizhio za na'a imani jin be Sokoe na uma'ajin be yan na'acin be ya'atso na e'dakpaya ya Soko e'la aya Soko zhi shi eyan tetengi yan izhea.

Surah 30:8      ,               Do they not reflect in their own minds Not but for just ends and for a term appointed did Allah create the heavens and the earth and all between them: yet are there truly many among men who deny the meeting with their Lord (at the Resurrection)!,Kashi zawangizhi e shi tsu'yin a cia kpaye a dan nin yan yangban'azhi boa N'gan Soko jin alita yan sanmazhi to kin to yan nanzhi fi taacin'abo na'a sai dai eti gaskiyao be iyaka nan yi eyan kpikpeci eba Soko nan.

Surah 30:10    ,        In the long run evil in the extreme will be the End of those who do evil; for that they rejected the Signs of Allah and held them up to ridicule.,Kanga gancin zoba yan za nanzhi'e lo etun dedezhi nan ci a bi  ebo nan a aya Soko (zhi) yi ganmanan aci kezhe'a fe e la aya Soko (zhi) mi.

Surah 30:33     ,            When trouble touches men they cry to their Lord turning back to Him in repentance: but when He gives them a taste of Mercy as from Himself behold some of them pay part-worship to other god´s besides their Lord-,Ka mi na batan ko egun uga de zawangi zhi nan a fe ti lali ya Tsocia aciga alamari kpata ku a kpe tso'u gancin u ga be'a yegun'U laa twarya ya sashi mini'abo a fe za nanzhi e la yan pa Soko baci nan.

Surah 30:39      ,               That which ye lay out for increase through the property of (other) people will have no increase with Allah: but that which ye lay out for charity seeking the Countenance of Allah (will increase): it is these who will get a recompense multiplied.,Yandondo nan ye ga la ya zazhi ebo u deba'ula'ube u dan mini ewo zazhio nan (ke ewo nuwan nan ko shasha nan) arziki yezhi a be nko Soko boa.

Surah 30:40    ,                 It is Allah Who has created you: further He has provided for your sustenance; then He will cause you to die; and again He will give you life. Are there any of your (false) "Partners" who can do any single one of these things Glory to Him! and high is He above the partners they attribute (to him)!,Soko ga jin halitta ye yeo U ci kezhe a ye ya arziki.

Surah 30:41 ,             Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of (the meed) that the hands of men have earned that (Allah) may give them a taste of some of their deeds: in order that they may turn back (from Evil).,Eyan nyin'a tu la ta eti kin bo to mini eduzhio ebo etun dede nanzhi egwa zawangizhie lo nan.

Surah 32:26   ,              Does it not teach them a lesson how many generations We destroyed before them in whose dwellings they (now) go to and fro Verily in that are Signs: Do they not then listen,Ngba U gaa fe ekpa yan bawu ya'aa Kendo yia ekundondo yan al'um mazhi nazhi shiadzonan jin hallaka na'a ngan a tso fe jin dalodazin fi mini emiazhio Akika mini alamari wuncinzhio sisantuzhi dan bo be egwawu yan zankpe Sokoe.

Surah 33:4       ,                    Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his (one) body: nor has He made your wives whom ye divorce by Zihar your mothers: nor has He made your adopted sons your sons.

Surah 33:5  ,                         Call them by (the names of) their fathers: that is juster in the sight of Allah.

Surah 33:6     ,                       The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves and his wives are their mothers. Blood-relations among each other have closer personal ties in the Decree of Allah. Than (the Brotherhood of) Believers and Muhajirs: nevertheless do ye what is just to your closest friends: such is the writing in the Decree (of Allah).,Annabi ga -- yin gan ya Muminizhi nan a ga la mi tu foro uzhi a gan yan ti tacin atsozhi nao Yinmin'uzhi ma Nnaazhi a yio.

Surah 33:9  ,                  O ye who believe!

Surah 33:13     ,                   Behold! A party among them said: "Ye men of Yathrib! ye cannot stand (the attack)! therefore go back!" And a band of them ask for leave of the Prophet saying "Truly our houses are bare and exposed" though they were not exposed they intended nothing but to run away.,To kaminan jama'a ndocizhi miniabo gan gan: "Ya ye Madina cizhi ye de edun a fea (shi yegboro Annabi boa) ebo acin'o ekezhe (da emi ezhi).

Surah 33:15,            And yet they had already covenanted with Allah not to turn their backs and a covenant with Allah must (surely) be answered for.,Akika ma shidzo batsozhio (munafiki nnazhi) a jin Soko alkawali ke yea ya zunmanan akika ma alkawali Soko eyan uyio nan aa gbin'a.

Surah 33:17 ,                      Say: "Who is it that can screen you from Allah if it be His wish to give you punishment or to give you Mercy" Nor will they find for themselves besides Allah any protector or helper.,Gan (ya) gan: Zei danbo nan a -- ye tswa be Sokoe nao kamina Soko ga kpa ye be azabae ko be yegun'y nap Ye ma'ade Ndakata ko taimako jin-ci a -- Soko gan'a.

Surah 33:19     ,                             Covetous over you. Then when fear comes thou wilt see them looking to thee their eyes revolving like (those of) one over whom hovers death: but when the fear is past they will smite you with sharp tongues covetous of goods. Such men have no faith and so Allah has made their deeds of none effect: and that is easy for Allah.,Za nnazhiy gaela taimako tanye yanbo gancin eyan dansun ga dzun fia wyo'a le eye'azhi ye fe danyi ke za nan tsutsu a rukpe u nan.

Surah 33:20 ,                     They think that the Confederates have not withdrawn; and if the Confederates should come (again) they would wish they were in the deserts (wandering) among the Bedouins and seeking news about you (from a safe distance); and if they were in your midst they would fight but little.,E' kpaye kpa gan jama'a kungunci yan kafirizhi laa loa jama'a wuncinzhi ma ga ke da zhin wun'a ba (munafikizhi) gan wun'ayi ezhitizhi boafio na.

Surah 33:22           ,      When the Believers saw the Confederate forces they said: "This is what Allah and his Messenger had promised us and Allah and His Messenger told us what was true." And it only added to their faith and their zeal in obedience.,Kamnan Muminizhi le jama'a kungunci yan kafirizhi ye nan a gan: nan-nan gayi alkawali nan Soko be Tuci'u yin jin yi nao akika Soko be Tuci'u yin ma a gaskiya ta wuncin ma be'a yandondoa sai dai imani ganni be kpatsun ta ya Sokoe.
Surah 33:23        ,         Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah: of them some have completed their vow (to the extreme) and some (still) wait: but they have never changed (their determination) in the least:,Mini Muminizhio bagizhi danbo nanzhi wu'gwa gaskiya eti alkawali nanzhi ajin be Sokoe nan.

Surah 33:25       ,        And Allah turned back the Unbelievers for (all) their fury: no advantage did they gain; and enough is Allah for the believers in their fight. And Allah is full of Strength able to enforce His Will.,Soko a kafirizhi yan daa zunma gan-ni be ewunzheazhiy a ma tso guri alhairi ndondoa Soko cia kunke ya Muminizhi be ekungun'y akika Soko Etsu kagbo uyio Etsu zankpe ma uyio.
Surah 33:26   ,            And those of the People of the Book who aided them - Allah did take them down from their strongholds and cast terror into their hearts. (So that) some ye slew and some ye made prisoners.,Soko cia zanazhi jin kafirizhi taimako mini za ba litafizhio nan cin ke ekpoazhi lugwa U cia gan be kagboazhi ucia edo la'ashe yangban'azhi (Ebo wuncin'o) ye fe wu zandocizhi miniabo ye ma fe wan ndocizhi wuzhizhi.
Surah 33:27  ,          And He made you heirs of their lands their houses and their goods and of a land which ye had not frequented (before). And Allah has power over all things.,Soko cia kin yan'azhi to emiazhi to dukiyazhi gi-gun ya ye to kin ndoci otso nan bici yezhi laa pabo leanan (kpata wun'a laa gigun ya ye).

Surah 33:32     ,             O Consorts of the Prophet!

Surah 33:33  ,                      And stay quietly in your houses and make not a dazzling display like that of the former Times of Ignorance; and establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity; and obey Allah and His Messenger.

Surah 33:35 ,                            For Muslim men and women- for believing men and women for devout men and women for true men and women for men and women who are patient and constant for men and women who humble themselves for men and women who give in Charity for men and women who fast (and deny themselves) for men and women who guard their chastity and for men and women who engage much in Allah´s praise- for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.,Akika Musulumi bagi to Musulumi ynzagizhi to Mumini bagizhi to Mumini ynzagizhi to bagi nanzhi acin dan ibada jin'o nan to ynzagi nanzhi a cin dan ibada jin'o nan to bagizhi nanzhi yi za gaskiyazhi nan to bagi nanzhi e jin hakuri nan to ynzagi nanzhi e jin hakurinan to bagi nanzhie dakpya nan to ynzagi nanzhie dakpya nan to bagi nanzhi ejin sadaka nan to ynzagi nanzhie jin sadaka na to bagi nanzhie fe azun nan to ynzagi nanzhie fe azun nan to bagi nanzhie tswa kaafaazhi nan to ynzagi nanzhie tswa kaafaazhi nan to bagi nanzhi e tun Soko ye dokun nan to ynzagi nanzhi gae tun Soko ye dokun nan (kpata'a) Soko jin shiri yan gafara be laada nan wancin nae yaa.
Surah 33:36          ,             It is not fitting for a Believer man or woman when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if any one disobeys Allah and His Messenger he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path.,U -- yin ya Mumini bagi to Mumini ynzagia kaminan Soko be Tuci'uyin ga hukunci ba eti alamari ndocio nan nan aada wa etsa ndoci ke alamari Soko lugwa na'a.

Surah 33:37         ,                                     Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thy favour: "Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife and fear Allah." But thou didst hide in thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her with the necessary (formality) We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And Allah´s command must be fulfilled.,Wyo mao pa kaminan wyo fe gan be za nan Soko jin ni'ima ya wyo tso ma jin ni'ima yanan gan: "A egwa sun yinmin'o wyo mao sundan Soko wyo mae so dan yangban wyo bo yan nan Soko gau tula nan wyo mae sundan zawangizhi Soko ga ma -- yin nan wyo'a sundan'u nao.

Surah 33:38         ,            There can be no difficulty to the Prophet in what Allah has indicated to him as a duty. It was the practice (approved) of Allah amongst those of old that have passed away. And the command of Allah is a decree determined.,Le fi ndondo ta ti Annabi boa mini yan nan Soko'ajin halali ya'una'a wuncin ma ekpa yan Soko uyio dan mini za nanzhi shidzo nao alamari Soko ma kadara uyio nan gaa fe nan.
Surah 33:39   ,         (It is the practice of those) who preach the Messages of Allah and fear Him and fear none but Allah. And enough is Allah to call (men) to account.,Za nanzhi e wu yan egan Soko nan a mae sundan u ke dansun zandoci lugwa nan akika Sokoa kunke yaa eba egagbao.
Surah 33:40       ,         Muhammad is not the father of any of your men but (he is) the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets: and Allah has full knowledge of all things.,(Annabi) Muhammadu fe nda ya zaeni ndondo mini bagi-ezhi boa ammade u yi Tuci Soko be emigun yan Annabizhiy.

Surah 33:47 ,      Then give the Glad Tidings to the Believers that they shall have from Allah a very great Bounty.,Wyo mao ya Muminizhi labari yangban-fa ke falala nan wancin nan a jin tabbata yaa dan nko yan Soko-na.
Surah 33:48     ,      And obey not (the behests) of the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites and heed not their annoyances but put thy Trust in Allah. For enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs.,Wyo mao ga lamitu kafirizhi to munafikizhi ma Wyo mao dzungan egun'azhio Wyo mao lao yaokpe Soko Soko ma'akunke nan'aya kpe'u nan.
Surah 33:49     ,                O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women and then divorce them before ye have touched them no period of ´Iddat have ye to count in respect of them: so give them a present. And set them free in a handsome manner.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan!

We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts who migrated (from Makka) with thee; and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her;- this only for thee and not for the Believers (at large); We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess;- in order that there should be no difficulty for thee. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Ya wyoe Annabi Akika yia yinmin wyo zhi nanzhi wyo ya sadaaki a nan la ajin halali ya wyoe to nanzhi egwa gwalo wye jin mulki nan mini ganima nanzhi Soko la ya wye to egi ynzagi yan ndagi wyozhi to egi ynzagi yan -- -- wyozhi nanzhi kpela (lo Madina) ganni be wyo yin nan to ynzagi ndondo nan ga miniu la ya Annabi nan Annabi otso gae wau eti yinmio nan nnan tso ma yi tsitsaci ya wye banbe Mumini nan ke nan zhiy.

This were nigher to the cooling of their eyes the prevention of their grief and their satisfaction - that of all of them - with that which thou hast to give them: and Allah knows (all) that is in your hearts: and Allah is All-Knowing Most Forbearing.,Na ga ba wyoe miniabo nan gangan u la'u pauta na ma ga ba wye nan uu dinba na wyoe ga ke wa mini nanzhi wyo gan a laa paatanan lefi danbo ya wyo yea.

Enter not the Prophet´s houses- until leave is given you- for a meal (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation: but when ye are invited enter; and when ye have taken your meal disperse without seeking familiar talk. Such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet: he is ashamed to dismiss you but Allah is not ashamed (to tell you) the truth. And when ye ask (his ladies) for anything ye want ask them from before a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs. Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy Allah´s Messenger or that ye should marry his widows after him at any time. Truly such a thing is in Allah´s sight an enormity.,Ya ye nanzhi a imani jin nan! E ga kara gandan emi Annabi (zhio) ma sai aga ya ye izini gan ye be gi yangici.

Surah 33:55    ,                         There is no blame (on these ladies if they appear) before their fathers or their sons their brothers or their brother´s sons or their sisters´ sons or their women or the (slaves) whom their right hands possess. And (ladies) fear Allah; for Allah is Witness to all things.,Lefi danbo ya ynzagi zhi'a mini gingandan yan emiazhia to yan babazhia to egiazhia to yegia bagizhia to egi yegia bagizhia to egi yegia ynzagizhia.

Surah 33:59    ,                O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters and the believing women that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad): that is most convenient that they should be known (as such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Ya wyoe Annabi!

Surah 35:10    ,                   If any do seek for glory and power- to Allah belong all glory and power. To Him mount up (all) Words of Purity: It is He Who exalts each Deed of Righteousness. Those that lay Plots of Evil- for them is a Penalty terrible; and the plotting of such will be void (of result).,Zandondo nan gae wa cin wan nan akika cinwan kpata egwa Soko bo u fio.

Surah 35:14      ,           If ye invoke them they will not listen to your call and if they were to listen they cannot answer your (prayer). On the Day of Judgment they will reject your "Partnership". and none (O man!) can tell thee (the Truth) like the One Who is acquainted with all things.,Ka ye ga'e yia e wo yiyi yezhia ka a ma ga wo a ya ye ezhe woa efo alkiyami ma a ga egwazhi wa be wiwo nan ye fe wo'a nan.

Not the least portion of it can be carried (by the other). Even though he be nearly related. Thou canst but admonish such as fear their Lord unseen and establish regular Prayer. And whoever purifies himself does so for the benefit of his own soul; and the destination (of all) is to Allah.,Zando ma'a la kara lefi yan zandocia.

Surah 35:19   ,The blind and the seeing are not alike;,Yebonci be za nan e le ba ye nan a jin ye nia.Surah 35:20   Nor are the depths of Darkness and the Light;Acinga bazhikozhi be haske a jin ye nia.
Surah 35:21   ,Nor are the (chilly) shade and the (genial) heat of the sun:,Ba yeko be ba yi pae a jin ye nia.
Surah 35:22   ,            Nor are alike those that are living and those that are dead. Allah can make any that He wills to hear; but thou canst not make those to hear who are (buried) in graves.,Acinga za nanzhi yi be rayi nan be za nanzhi'a tsu nan a jin ye nia. Akika Sokoe la gan-wo ya za nan ga ba'u nan. Wyo ma wyoa la za nanzhi fi kabario nan wo gan woa.
Surah 35:23  , Thou art no other than a warner.,Wyo de fea sai dai gangba jinci.
Surah 35:24   ,        Verily We have sent thee in truth as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner: and there never was a people without a warner having lived among them (in the past).,Akika Yi tun wyo tun-tun ganni be gaskiyae ebo wyo yaa labari yangbanfa wyo ma'o na'a wun akika mini al'umma ndondo eza danbo nan'e na'a wun nan.
Surah 35:25     ,       And if they reject thee so did their predecessors to whom came their messengers with Clear Signs Books of dark prophecies and the Book of Enlightenment.,A ma ga egan wyo yi ganmana za nanzhi shiadzo nan atso'a egan Tuciazhi yi ganmanan kaminan Tuciazhi be yaa be bayanizhi be hujja yan takadazhi be Litafi nan yi be haske nan.
Surah 35:26 ,     In the end did I punish those who rejected Faith: and how (terrible) was My rejection (of them)!,Gancin Mi cia za nanzhi ajin kafirinci nan wan ngba ke nangban yan etan winwan yan Soko yi nao
Surah 35:27  ,                   Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky With it We then bring out produce of various colours. And in the mountains are tracts white and red of various shades of colour and black intense in hue.,Ye le yea kendoe Sokoe du ele be dagan sanmao na'a Yi cia yangici sun-sunzhi la'atinya be ele iri yan sun-sunzhi ma yi kakayin. U ma ke jin dan mini patizhio ekohi nanzhiy yi bokun to dzuruzhiy nan atso ma yi iri kakayin ganni be ndocizhi nanzhi shizhiko sarauyin nan.
Surah 35:28      ,          And so amongst men and crawling creatures and cattle are they of various colours. Those truly fear Allah among His Servants who have knowledge: for Allah is Exalted in Might Oft-Forgiving.,To mini yan zawangizhio to dabbazhio to dabba yan emanwozhi atsozhi yi iri kakaayin acinga ayi baeni bo. Akika Manzhi gbaugi gae sundan Soko mini wuzhi'uzhi bo. Akika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu gafara.
Surah 35:29      ,         Those who rehearse the Book of Allah establish regular Prayer and spend (in Charity) out of what We have provided for them secretly and openly hope for a commerce that will never fail:,Akika za nanzhi egba litafi Soko nan ama sallah kugikini nan a mae wu dukiyazhi nan Yi la yaa nan fi eko wangizhio to swiswoci to gangbao nan akika za wuncinzhi e cewo nan a zunyaanan.
Surah 35:30   ,    For He will pay them their meed nay He will give them (even) more out of His Bounty: for He is Oft-Forgiving Most Ready to appreciate (service).,Ebo acin'o Soko ga lada'zhi shekpan yaa u ma'a kezhe bea mini falala'uzhio. Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yebo jin.
Surah 35:31      ,         That which We have revealed to thee of the Book is the Truth- confirming what was (revealed) before it: for Allah is assuredly- with respect to His Servants - well acquainted and Fully Observant.,Litafi nan tso Yi jin wahayi u be ya wyo nan wun ga yi gaskiya'o U maa gaskiya ya be nanzhi be shi'udzo nan. Akika Soko yi be kpikpe u mae le yannan wuzhi'uzhi dan'yn-ninbo nan ye.
Surah 35:32    ,                Then We have given the Book for inheritance to such of Our Servants as We have chosen: but there are among them some who wrong their own souls; some who follow a middle course; and some who are by Allah´s leave foremost in good deeds; that is the highest Grace.,Ganci yi cia Litafi laa gi gun ya eza tsitsacizhi mini wuzhi yi zhio ade miniabo nan'ejin ti tacin'u gun nan ama de nanzhi yi eza tacingizhi nan ama de nanzhi a shidzo be etu alhairizhi be yarda Sokoe nan.

Surah 35:33  ,          Gardens of Eternity will they enter: therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their garments there will be of silk.,Wato aljannazhi nan aga jin dawwama fi nan aga ganfi bo a ci ga pa nin fi bo be gadozhi nan'a jin be zinariyae to aluluyinan tufuwazhi ma mini aljannao u gayi ede yan alharirio (siliki).
Surah 35:34  ,        And they will say: "Praise be to Allah Who has removed from us (all) sorrow: for our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving Ready to appreciate (service):,Aci gan: Yebo kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko nan'a yangban-yin lakeyabo ya yi nan. Akika Tsoci yi Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yebo jin.
Surah 35:35  ,           "Who has out of His Bounty settled us in a Home that will last: no toil nor sense of weariness shall touch us therein.",Etsu nan'a yi cin fi emi yan danbo dan'o mini falala'u bo nan yia le wahala ndondo ye mini'u boa yi ma'awo ebo ndondo mini'u boa.
Surah 35:36 ,                But those who reject (Allah) - for them will be the Fire of Hell: No term shall be determined for them so they should die nor shall its Penalty be lightened for them. Thus do We reward every ungrateful one!,Za nanzhiy maa a jin kafirinci be Sokoe nan egagba yan enan jahannama wun'ajin tabbata ya'a a ga -- rayi beayin acia tsu'a  a ma'a jin sauki yan azaba ya'a. Acinga ga yi e ga kafiri ndondo gba'o.
Surah 35:37   ,                     Therein will they cry aloud (for assistance): "Our Lord! Bring us out: we shall work righteousness not the (deeds) we used to do!" - "Did We not give you long enough life so that he that would should receive admonition and (moreover) the warner came to you. So taste ye (the fruits of your deeds): for the wrong-doers there is no helper.",A ma fe yi kabara fi mini'u bo aafe gan gan: Ya wyo Tsoci yi!

Surah 35:38 ,        Verily Allah knows (all) the hidden things of the heavens and the earth: verily He has full knowledge of all that is in (men´s) hearts.,Akika Soko yi be kpikpe yan yannanzhi swo fi sanmazhio to kin bo nan.Akika Soko yi be kpikpe yan yannanzhi swo fi yangbanzhio nan.
Surah 35:39  ,                     He it is That has made you inheritors in the earth: if then any do reject (Allah) their rejection (works) against themselves: their rejection but adds to the odium for the Unbelievers in the sight of their Lord: their rejection but adds to (their own) undoing.,Soko ga la ye cia fe halifazhi kpe kinbo.

Kafirinci yan kafirizhi man wun'a be'a yandondo eba Tsociaboa sai dai hallaka kafirinci yan kafirizhia bea yandondoa sai dai hasara.
Surah 35:40 ,                               Say: "Have ye seen (these) ´Partners´ of yours whom ye call upon besides Allah Show Me what it is they have created in the (wide) earth. Or have they a share in the heavens Or have We given them a Book from which they (can derive) clear (evidence)- Nay the wrong-doers promise each other nothing but delusions.,Gan gan: Ye le ye'a za nanzhi ye la a pa mi baci nan ye cie jin bauta ya;a ke Soko lugwa nan e la'wu Mi yin kiy zhiy a jin halittau kpe eti kinbo kashi a pama ganni be Sokoe eba jin-jin yan sanmao kashi yi la Litafi ndoci la ya'a kayin nantso a fe hujja ya'a nan U jin acin'a akika azwalumizhi de a de yannanzhi e la jin dozhi alkawali na'a sai dai eta.
Surah 35:41     ,             It is Allah Who sustains the heavens and the earth lest they cease (to function): and if they should fail there is none - not one - can sustain them thereafter: Verily He is Most Forbearing Oft-Forgiving.,Akika Soko ga la egwa sun sanmazhi to kin aci du'a yin'o akika a ma ga du-du zaeni ndondo la egwa sun'u wo baci Soko boa. Akika Soko Etsu hakuri uyio Etsu gaafara uyio.
Surah 35:42 ,                 They swore their strongest oaths by Allah that if a warner came to them they would follow his guidance better than any (other) of the Peoples: But when a warner came to them it has only increased their flight (from righteousness)-,A ma zhi kuti be Sokoe iyaka yan kuti zhi'a zhi gan: Akika gangba jinci ga be ya'a a gaafe dan mini aluma nanzhi a gwo bawu gan zazhi nan kaminan gangba jinci be be yaanan u bea yandondoa sai de kpikpe-yai be bawu'y.
Surah 35:43   ,                      On account of their arrogance in the land and their plotting of Evil but the plotting of Evil will hem in only the authors thereof. Now are they but looking for the way the ancients were dealt with But no change wilt thou find in Allah´s way (of dealing): no turning off wilt thou find in Allah´s way (of dealing).,Ebo eti kagbo ta eti kinbo be makirinci dede U mae cin ta eti zando boa sai eti za nan'e jin'u nan. Eza nan-nanzhiy a'tu yandondo ye'a sai de ekpa yan egagba iri yan za mafarizhi. Wyo ma'atsun egbazhe dan ekpa Soko boa wyo m'atsun egwa-san dan mini ekpa Soko boa.
Surah 35:44         ,                    Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them- though they were superior to them in strength Nor is Allah to be frustrated by anything whatever in the heavens or on earth: for He is All-Knowing. All-Powerful.,Kashi! E za-za kpe eti kinboa acia cin'ale a lo kendoe zoba yan zanazhi shiadzo nan yi-yi na'a a maafe gan a gboka gan'a. yandondo ma gan Soko gwaa dan mini sanmazhio ko kin boa. Akika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu iko.
Surah 35:45       ,                 If Allah were to punish men according to what they deserve. He would not leave on the back of the (earth) a single living creature: but He gives them respite for a stated Term: when their Term expires verily Allah has in His sight all His Servants.,Da agan Soko e din-ye-din wan zazhi be lefi'azhi da a de rayi ndondo ke ta eti kin boa amaade wyun'e pata ya'a da lokaci nan yi be iyakae nan.

﻿Surah 36:1, Ya Sin,YASIN (Bayanizhi shidzo eti'u bo'ani)
Surah 36:2 ,By the Qur´an full of Wisdom,Mi'e zhi kuti be Alkuranuy nan'ashe be hikimae nan
Surah 36:3 , Thou art indeed one of the messengers,Akika Wyoe (Muhammadu) wyo dan mini TucizhioSurah 36:4  On a Straight WayWyo ta eti ekpa nantso yi gboro nanSurah 36:5  It is a Revelation sent down by (Him) the Exalted in Might Most Merciful(Alkur'anu) ma u cin cin be dagan eba Soko nan yi Etsu zankpe nan Etsu yegun
Surah 36:6    ,  In order that thou mayest admonish a people whose fathers had received no admonition and who therefore remain heedless (of the Signs of Allah),Ebo wyo jin gangba'o ya jama'a nanzhi a jin gangba ya yanmanci'azhi'a nan a cia fe dan eyeyaona
Surah 36:7   ,    The Word is proved true against the greater part of them: for they do not believe,Akika hukunci Soko (azaba) a jin tabbata eti kundondoa bo ebo nan ya gaskiya'a na
Surah 36:8       ,  We have put yokes round their necks right up to their chins so that their heads are forced up (and they cannot see),Akika Yi'a kuruzhi ku fia kpatsun'azhio har da da'a wan nungbeazhi ebo acin'o eti'azhi a kan ta fitio
Surah 36:9   ,        And We have put a bar in front of them and a bar behind them and further We have covered them up; so that they cannot see,Yi cia yekan la'a dan yegboro'a bo yekan ma'dan to zunma'abo Yi cia eyan la a'rukpe'a aci le ba ye bea
Surah 36:10 ,      The same is it to them whether thou admonish them or thou do not admonish them: they will not believe,Yeni ma'u yi eba'abo ko wyo jin'a gangba ko ma wyo ga jin'a ma ajin za nanzhi a ya gaskiya na'a
Surah 36:11   ,        Thou canst but admonish such a one as follows the Message and fears the (Lord) Most Gracious unseen: give such a one therefore good tidings of Forgiveness and a Reward most generous,Akika wyoe jin gangba jin ya za nan gae la mitu foro Alkur'ani nan u mae kezhe sundan Soko swiswociy nan (Annabi) ya'u labari yangban fa be gafara yan Sokoe to lada nan wancin nan
Surah 36:12    ,         Verily We shall give life to the dead and We record that which they send before and that which they leave behind and of all things have We taken account in a clear Book (of evidence),Akika Yi gaela rayi dan eyan tsutsucizhio Yi ma ga etun nan zhi a la shidzo nan ka to ekpa nanzhiy a da nan Yandondo ma Yi'u jin lisafi dan mini litafi nan wancin uma yi gbangba na
Surah 36:13  ,     Set forth to them by way of a parable the (story of) the Companions of the City Behold! there came messengers to it,Wyo mao la misali'o wu'a yan jama'a yan alkarya ndoci ka mi nan Tucizhi be ya'a na
Surah 36:14,          When We (first) sent to them two messengers they rejected them: But We strengthened them with a third: they said Truly we have been sent on a mission to you,Ka mi nan Yi tun Tuci guba fi'a nan a cia egan'azhi yi gasmanan Yi ci'a be kagbo be za taci'y a ci gan; Akika yi de Tucizhi yiyi be ebayeyeo
Surah 36:15    ,          The (people) said: Ye are only men like ourselves; and (Allah) Most Gracious sends no sort of revelation: ye do nothing but lie,A ci gan: ye yi za'ndo'a sai dai zawangi dozhin yi  Soko (ALRAHMANU) ma cin yan'ndondo be'a ye de ganmanan tsaba u ga ye zun'o
Surah 36:16 ,    They said: Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you:,A ci gan: Tsociyi u yi be kpikpe ke de Tucizhi yi'yi be eba ye ye'o nao
Surah 36:17  ,  And our duty is only to proclaim the clear Message,Etunndo ma ta eti yi bo'a sai dai yanwu nan yi be bayani'y nan
Surah 36:18     ,      The (people) said: for us we augur an evil omen from you: if ye desist not we will certainly stone you And a grievous punishment indeed will be inflicted on you by us,A ci gan: Yi ye cin'ye le eza de dezhi kagan ma ye lugwa'a yi gae ce yan ye ma ga'gun be azaba nan tannan dagan eba yi bo
Surah 36:19  ,      They said: Your evil omens are with yourselves: (deem ye this an evil omen) If ye are admonished Nay but ye are a people transgressing all bounds!,A ci gan: cincinle yan eyan dedeyezhi u dan ganni be ye tsoe kashi ebo tukpa nan a paye nan (u ga la ye ci gan acin'o) A'a ye de fe'a saidaiza nanzhi'e nyin yanzhi nan
Surah 36:20     ,    Then there came running from the farthest part of the City a man saying O my people! Obey the messengers:,Eza bagi ndoci ci be dagan efu nanlokpa gan mini ezhio nao u fe dinye u ci gan: Ya ye jamaazhi ya emi tu Tucizhi
Surah 36:21   ,   Obey those who ask no reward of you (for themselves) and who have themselves received Guidance,Yea emi tu za nazhi e gbin ye gan yan lada etun'azhi a nana ma kezhe yi eza eko gboro nan (eza bawuzhi nan)
Surah 36:22    ,   It would not be reasonable in me if I did not serve Him Who created me and to Whom ye shall (all) be brought back,Kiyma a kan mi cia jin bawta ya Etsu nanjin alita mi yin'a naa yin'o ezhekeba ye kpata ma u dan eba u bo
Surah 36:23     ,         Shall I take (other) gods besides Him If (Allah) Most Gracious should intend some adversity for me of no use whatever will be their intercession for me nor can they deliver me,Ngba mi ga za'ndoci baci Soko la gan wyun gayi ndakatao Ngan Soko (ALRAHMANU) wun'a kpa mimacinle ndoci be mi yin gwatan yan zandodo'a wun'a jin mi amfania a ma bo mi yawo'a
Surah 36:24  ,  I would indeed if I were to do so be in manifest Error,Akika mi ga jin acin mi ga'fe dan mini egbin'o nantso a tu la na
Surah 36:25,   For me I have faith in the Lord of you (all): listen then to me!,Akika mi'a imanijin ganni be Tsoci ye yin ye mae laefe erie ya mi
Surah 36:26  ,    It was said: Enter thou the Garden He said: Ah me! Would that my People knew (what I know)!,Aci gan'u gan: A gandan Aljannao U gan: kasa! da'aci gan jamaa yan mizhi de kpikpe (yan alhairi na Soko jin ya mi nan)
Surah 36:27   ,   For that my Lord has granted me Forgiveness and has enrolled me among those held in honour!,To fifa nan u fa be mi yin nae U ci kezhea mi la'adan ezacinwancizhio
Surah 36:28   ,         And We sent not down against his People after him any hosts from heaven nor was it needful for Us so to do,Yi ma cin ekungunci ndondo be ya jamaa yan'u zhi zunma'u boa Yi ma cin be le'a
Surah 36:29  ,     It was no more than a single mighty Blast and behold! they were (like ashes) quenched and silent,Alamaria u fe'a sai dai kabara nini kpata ci'a fe eza tsutsucizhi
Surah 36:30    ,      Ah! Alas for (My) Servants! There comes not a messenger to them but they mock him!,Egiti yan robonkpe wun'ajin tabbata ta eti wuzhizhio kamindondo nan tuci gabe ya'anan aa fe za nazhi e la'u mi nan
Surah 36:31  ,        See they not how many generations before them we destroyed Not to them will they return:,Kashi a le ba yele'a ekun dondo za nanzhi Yi jin'a hallaka shi'a dzo mini alummazhio na akika Za wuncinzhi a kezhe zhin eba'a be'a
Surah 36:32  ,   But each one of them all  will be brought before Us (for judgment),Akika ma kpata a gaa ku ye kanbe zhi yegboro Yi bo
Surah 36:33    ,     A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life and produce grain therefrom of which ye do eat,U ma dan mini egwa wu yan zankpe Soko ya'a Kin na'a tsu nan yi'u dan rayi yi cia yangici sunsunzhi la'atin yardagan mini'u bo U cia fe yangici nanzhi e gi nan
Surah 36:34    ,     And We produce therein orchard with datepalms and vines and We cause springs to gush forth therein:,Yi cikezhea lati yan dobinazhi jin dan nin'yin'u bo to yangici inabizhi Yi ci kezhea eye nuwanzhi la'atinya fi mini'u bo
Surah 36:35   ,    That they may enjoy the fruits of this (artistry): It was not their hands that made this: will they not then give thanks,Ebo a fea de'agi dagan yangici sunsun'uzhio to nazhi a tso ga la egwazhi ci lo'tun'u nan Ngba za'nnazhi'a jin yebo ya Soko'a
Surah 36:36  ,          Glory to Allah Who created in pairs all things that the earth produces as well as their own (human) kind and (other) things of which they have no knowledge,Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu na'a alittazhi kpata jin eba be yiwo'e nan Dagan mini yannanzhi yin tinya kinbo na to mini 'atso (Zawangizhio) to yannazhi a de kpikpe wun'a nan
Surah 36:37    ,    And a Sign for them is the Night: We withdraw therefrom the Day and behold they are plunged in darkness;,U ma dan mini egwa wu yan zankpe Soko yeshi na Yi'a jin yi wa ebatin tin'ya dagan mini'u bo na alittazhi ci gaa fe dan mini bazhiko
Surah 36:38  ,     And the sun runs his course for a period determined for him: that is the decree of (Him) the Exalted in Might the AllKnowing,To igidi'otso wun'ajin u fe bi ci da iyaka yan ecinba'u Nannan shiri u yio yan Soko na yi Etsu zankpe nan an yi Etsu kpikpe nan
Surah 36:39   ,   And the Moon We have measured for her mansions (to traverse) till she returns like the old (and withered) lower part of a datestalk,To etswa'o tso yi'a ecinbazhi tswa cigban dobina gbako na
Surah 36:40   ,           It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon nor can the Night outstrip the Day: Each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law),Wun'a ye jin ya igidi nan wun'a tso etswa na'a yeshi maashi batin dzo'a ndondo'a ma gun mini falakio a cie je za
Surah 36:41    ,   And a Sign for them is that We bore their race (through the Flood) in the loaded Ark;,U ma dan mini egwa wu yan zankpe Soko ya'a yi'a zuriya'azhi ku fi mini eya'o nan yi shisheci nan
Surah 36:42    , And We have created for them similar (vessels) on which they ride,Yi ma kejin in'u zhi ya'a nan a fe de tu nan
Surah 36:43  ,      If it were Our Will We could drown them: then would there be no helper (to hear their cry) nor could they be delivered,U ma ga ba yi yi gaajin hallaka fi mini edwo a ma'a de za nan'ajin'a taimako na'a a ma ade zanan'a wo'a tinya na'a
Surah 36:44,     Except by way of Mercy from Us and by way of (world) convenience (to serve them) for a time,Sai de yegan dagan eba yi bo be emawo yan etapa daaeka ndoci
Surah 36:45,          When they are told Fear ye that which is before you and that which will be after you in order that ye may receive Mercy (they turn back),A ma ga gan ya'gan: e sundan yan alamari na ci ye gboro'e bo na to nan tso dan zunmae bo nan be'acin ma Soko'a gun'e ye
Surah 36:46     ,     Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord but they turn away therefrom,A ya ndondo na ga be ya' dangan mini aya yan Soko zhio na a'jin a zunma zhe ta
Surah 36:46          Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord but they turn away therefrom,A ya ndondo na ga be ya' dangan mini aya yan Soko zhio na a'jin a zunma zhe ta
Surah 36:47 ,                      And when they are told Spend ye of (the bounties) with which Allah has provided you the Unbelievers say to those who believe: Shall we then feed those whom if Allah had so willed He would have fed (Himself) Ye are in nothing but manifest error,A ma ga gan yaagan: efe wu dukiya yezhi mini nanzhi Soko la arziki'u ya ye nan (fi eko guru'o) Za nanzhi ajin kafirinci nan'a gan be za tsaabe la yangici ya za nan u ga be Soko gan wun'a ya'ugi u gaaya'u gi nao Akika (eza iri nazhi) a fe'a sai de dan mini egbin nan'a tulanao
Surah 36:48  ,    Further they say When will this promise (come to pass) if what ye say is true,A ma'jin a fe gan gan: Fo ci alkawali (yan alkiyami) a yio wun'ayi gaskiya tsa ye tao nao
Surah 36:49  ,     They will not (have to) wait for aught but a single Blast: it will seize them while they are yet disputing among themselves!,Yando danbo nan e tu ye na'a sai de kabara ninikete Nan a dzun dzun fia lokaci nan mini ekoce yan eyan wa yan izeo nao
Surah 36:50 ,     No (chance) will they then have by will to dispose (of their affairs) nor to return to their own people!Kanga a'de iko yan wasiyya jin'a a ma'ade ezhe ke lo eba iyaliazhi bea
Surah 36:51  ,       The trumpet shall be sounded when behold! from the sepulchres (men) will rush forth to their Lord!,Aci ga kafo be gancin a cia fe gu tinya dagan kabarizhio a cia fe lo eba Tsocia
Surah 36:52    ,       They will say: Ah! Woe unto us! Who hath raised us up from our beds of repose (A voice will say:) This is what (Allah) Most Gracious had promised And true was the word of the messengers!,A cia gan gan: Kasaayi re! zae yi za na nanyikin dagan elele ba yi bo nao (A cia ya'ezhe gan: Ngan nannan ga yi yannan Soko Etsu yegun fe la jin yi alkawali nao Tucizhi ma a gaskiya ta
Surah 36:53 ,        It will be no more than a single Blast when lo! they will all be brought up before Us!,Akika alamari nannan ufe'a sai de kabara nini ke gancin kpata ci gaa gun yekan zhi yagboro Yi bo
Surah 36:54 ,         Then on that Day not a soul will be wronged in the least and ye shall but be repaid the meeds of your past Deeds,Yinnan nnan aajin rayi ndondo egun ndondoa a maa ga'e gbaa sai de be iri etun nanzhi ye fe lo (izheo)nan

Surah 4:2  ,             To orphans restore their property (When they reach their age) nor substitute (your) worthless things for (their) good ones; and devour not their substance (by mixing it up) with your own.

If the guardian is well-off Let him claim no remuneration but if he is poor let him have for himself what is just and reasonable. When ye release their property to them take witnesses in their presence: But all-sufficient is Allah in taking account,Ye mae ma ekungizhie cin'ele har da lokaci na'aga kun yawo yin jin na.

For parents a sixth share of the inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children and the parents are the (only) heirs the mother has a third; if the deceased Left brothers (or sisters) the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases (´s) after the payment of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether your parents or your children are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-knowing Al-wise,Soko mae jin waswinci dan mini egi yezhio. Bagi wun'a de robo iri natso yi yan yinzagi guba na.

In what ye leave their share is a fourth if ye leave no child; but if ye leave a child they get an eighth; after payment of legacies and debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants nor descendants but has left a brother or a sister each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two they share in a third; after payment of legacies and debts; so that no loss is caused (to any one).

Surah 4:17,                  Allah accept the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent soon afterwards; to them will Allah turn in mercy: For Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom,Akika tuba natso yi gwigwoci eba Soko na uyi ya zanazhi gae lo tun dede eti jahilincio na gancin (na'abea kpe na) acie jin tuba vava yin nao.

Surah 4:18 ,                      Of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil until death faces one of them and he says "Now have I repented indeed;" nor of those who die rejecting Faith: for them have We prepared a punishment most grievous,Ujin tuba u yia na ezazhia fe lo 'tun dedezhi har da lokaci na ajali a be ya zaenia naa.

Surah 4:19  ,                               O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness that ye may Take away part of the dower ye have given them-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing and Allah brings about through it a great deal of good.

Surah 4:24 ,                                        Also (prohibited are) women already married except those whom your right hands possess: Thus hath Allah ordained (Prohibitions) against you: Except for these all others are lawful provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property- desiring chastity not lust seeing that ye derive benefit from them give them their dowers (at least) as prescribed; but if after a dower is prescribed agree Mutually (to vary it) there is no blame on you and Allah is All-knowing All-wise,(Mini nazhi yi haramu be na) yinzagi nazhia yawo jin'a ni na sai de na egwa gwalo ye gaejin mulki na.

Surah 4:25   ,                                                     If any of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women they may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess: And Allah hath full knowledge about your faith. Ye are one from another: Wed them with the leave of their owners and give them their dowers according to what is reasonable: They should be chaste not lustful nor taking paramours: when they are taken in wedlock if they fall into shame their punishment is half that for free women. This (permission) is for those among you who fear sin; but it is better for you that ye practise self-restraint. And Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Za na ma be de bagwo na uga'ajin yawo yan yinzagi kiriki Muminizhi woa na to (a jin yawo) dagan mini yinzagi nazhi gwaloazhie jin mulki be yin na yinzagi wuzhizhi na zhi yi Muminizhi na.

Surah 4:26 ,            Allah doth wish to make clear to you and to show you the ordinances of those before you; and (He doth wish to) turn to you (In Mercy): And Allah is All-knowing All-wise,Sokoe kpa kpa gan Wyun'ula bayaniU jin'u yaye Uma'au wuyeba'u ta eti ekpa wangizhi yan za nazhi shi ye dzo na Uma u gwo tuba jin yan ye.

Surah 4:27,            Allah doth wish to Turn to you but the wish of those who follow their lusts is that ye should turn away (from Him)- far far away,Soko mae kpa kpa gan Wyun'u gwo tuba jin yan ye.

Surah 4:29 ,                     O ye who believe!

Surah 4:31,           If ye (but) eschew the most heinous of the things which ye are forbidden to do We shall expel out of you all the evil in you and admit you to a gate of great honour,Ye ga'kpeya be zunubi kozhi nazhi akan ye yin jin na Yi ga etun dede yezhi finya yaye Yima ga ye la'agandan dan na yan cinwan'o.
Surah 4:32,                          And in no wise covet those things in which Allah Hath bestowed His gifts More freely on some of you than on others: To men is allotted what they earn and to women what they earn: But ask Allah of His bounty. For Allah hath full knowledge of all things,Ye mae ga fe la yangban dede ebo falala na Soko la'ya sashi yezhi ta eti sashi yezhio na ma (guri dede tso).

Surah 4:33  ,                To (benefit) every one We have appointed shares and heirs to property left by parents and relatives. To those also to whom your right hand was pledged give their due portion.

Surah 4:34 ,                                      Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in (the husband´s) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct admonish them (first) (Next) refuse to share their beds (And last) beat them (lightly); but if they return to obedience seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High great (above you all),Bagizhi agayi eye ladancizhi yan yinzagizhio ebo falala na Soko laya sashiazhi ta eti yan sashio na to ebo yannazhi e'wu dagan mini dukiya'azhio na.

Surah 4:35,                     If ye fear a breach between them twain appoint (two) arbiters one from his family and the other from hers; if they wish for peace Allah will cause their reconciliation: For Allah hath full knowledge and is acquainted with all things,Ye ma gae sundan yan emice leba tsakaniabo (eba be yinmiy) za gubaba; ye'a za na ga'jin gyara mini yegi ebazhio na to za na ga'jingyara dagan mini yegi yinmizhio na tun tun (eti gyara jin'o) a ga' kpa gan a la gyara'ajin Soko ga ganganna la'adan tsakaniabo be dozhiy.

Surah 4:36 ,                              Serve Allah and join not any partners with Him; and do good- to parents kinsfolk orphans those in need neighbours who are near neighbours who are strangers the companion by your side the wayfarer (ye meet) and what your right hands possess: For Allah loveth not the arrogant the vainglorious,Ye mae jin bautae ya Soko ye mae ga la yandondo pa'U baci ma ye mae fe'jin bolobolo be yanmanci gubabae to dangi nazhi tsoba na to ekungizhi to eza gwa gbagi zhi be emi le tsogun na tsoba na to emi le tsogun na'akpe ya na to eya yan kansan ta to egi eko (na ta eti ezan'ona) to yan na egwa gwalo ye gae jin mulki beyin na Akika Sokoe wa za nae leti u ye cie jin alfari na'a.
Surah 4:37 ,             (Nor) those who are niggardly or enjoin niggardliness on others or hide the bounties which Allah hath bestowed on them; for We have prepared for those who resist Faith a punishment that steeps them in contempt,Za nazhie tan yanbo na acie kezhe jin zazhi umurni be yanbotan'e na ama'ajin afe' swo yannazhi Soko laya' mini azaba yan zunyesun.
Surah 4:38  ,              Not those who spend of their substance to be seen of men but have no faith in Allah and the Last Day: If any take the Evil One for their intimate what a dreadful intimate he is!,Za nazhi mae wu dukiya'azhi ebo'a la'a wu zawangizhi na a ma jin imani yin'a na Zandondo na ma shetan ga'azhe eya manci ya nato bibi ajin tabbata ya eya manci wuncin.
Surah 4:39 ,             And what burden Were it on them if they had faith in Allah and in the Last Day and they spent out of what Allah hath given them for sustenance For Allah hath full knowledge of them,Ki-ma yi le'fiao aga imani jinjin be Sokoe be efo Alkiyami nao aci wu dukiya (fi eko Soko) mini na Soko la arzikiU ya'a nao Soko ma yi be kpikpe'yan nazhi a danyn ninbo na.

Surah 4:40,              Allah is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good (done) He doubleth it and giveth from His own presence a great reward,Akika Sokoe jin gun'a ka wun'a yi yan gwargwado zarra'a wun'a yi etun wangi ga eza lo' Uga la'adazhi kpeba dozhi yan Ucia ke'la egagba na wancin na a yan dagan eba Wyuntso.

Surah 4:42,             On that day those who reject Faith and disobey the messenger will wish that the earth Were made one with them: But never will they hide a single fact from Allah!,Fo wuncin za nazhia jin kafirinci acie le Tuci (Soko) ba na a'wa gan ala a yea la'azhe ye'ni be jikannae a ma la labari ndondo swo Soko woa.
Surah 4:43  ,                                             O ye who believe! Approach not prayers with a mind befogged until ye can understand all that ye say- nor in a state of ceremonial impurity (Except when travelling on the road) until after washing your whole body. If ye are ill or on a journey or one of you cometh from offices of nature or ye have been in contact with women and ye find no water then take for yourselves clean sand or earth and rub therewith your faces and hands. For Allah doth blot out sins and forgive again and again,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega kara tsoba jin jin swalla kamina ye ga'pe na ma sai ye ga kpe yanna yeye'gan na .

Surah 4:45 ,       But Allah hath full knowledge of your enemies: Allah is enough for a protector and Allah is enough for a Helper,Soko-otso ma kpe makiri yezhiye gan Zandondo. Soko ma'a kunke yan Ndakata Soko ma'akunke Taimako jinci.
Surah 4:46,                                     Of the Jews there are those who displace words from their (right) places and say: "We hear and we disobey"; and "Hear what is not Heard"; and "Ra´ina"; with a twist of their tongues and a slander to Faith. If only they had said: "What hear and we obey"; and "Do hear"; and "Do look at us"; it would have been better for them and more proper; but Allah hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe,Mini za nazhi yi Yahuduzhi na ade nazhie la egan zhegba ke dan na'a lugwa na.

Surah 4:48,                   Allah forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else to whom He pleaseth; to set up partners with Allah is to devise a sin Most heinous indeed,Akika Sokoe fa na eza'ala yandonci a'pau baci na; Umae fa be ndoci yan wuncin'y be za na gabaU na zandondo na ma gae la yan pa Soko baci na akika zawuncin'a le'fi na wancin na tswa.
Surah 4:49 ,            Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who claim sanctity for themselves Nay-but Allah Doth sanctify whom He pleaseth. But never will they fail to receive justice in the least little thing,Ngba wyo le za nazhie li 'ti tacin'a na yea A'a Sokoe tsae li za na ga baU nao. Amma'a jin'a zwalunci ka wun'a gbagba'a.

Surah 4:51 ,                  Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were given a portion of the Book they believe in sorcery and Evil and say to the Unbelievers that they are better guided in the (right) way Than the believers!Ngba wyo ta ye le ye lo eba za nazhia la robo ya mini Litafio na'a Gancin acie da jin imani be kutizhiy to be Shetan (nae tswa ganmana ta Soko na) acie gan be za nazhia jin kafirinci na; "Za na nazhi a kpe eko bawuo gan za nazhi gan a imani jin na."
Surah 4:52  ,       They are (men) whom Allah hath cursed: And those whom Allah Hath cursed thou wilt find have no one to help,Za wuncinzhi ga Soko bo 'mio za ndondo na ma Soko ga'bo 'mi na wun'ade zandondo na'ajin'u taimako na'a.

Surah 4:54 ,                Or do they envy mankind for what Allah hath given them of his bounty but We had already given the people of Abraham the Book and Wisdom and conferred upon them a great kingdom,Kashi e'jin zawangizhi hasada jin be eryatwa yan Soko na Ula ya'a na Akika yi la Litafi be Hakimae ya za 'mi Ibrahimazhi Yi ma ke'la mulki na wancin na ya'a.

Surah 4:56                   Those who reject our Signs We shall soon cast into the Fire: as often as their skins are roasted through We shall change them for fresh skins that they may taste the penalty: for Allah is Exalted in Power Wise,Akika  za nazhia jin kafirinci be aya Yi zhi-na be le'yin Yi ga'la gandan enao kandondo na epa'azhi ga'gyena na Yi ga epandoncizhi sangwa ya'a ebo atsoa fin azaba.

Surah 4:57  ,                 But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness We shall soon admit to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath- their eternal home: Therein shall they have companions pure and holy: We shall admit them to shades cool and ever deepening,Za nazhi ma imani jin na aci lotun wangi wangizhi na Yi ga'la gandan Aljannazhio na nuwanzhie je fi takoubo na ama' fibo tutun yin ama'a yi be yinmi lilicizhi fi bo.

Surah 4:58 ,                       Allah doth command you to render back your Trusts to those to whom they are due; And when ye judge between man and man that ye judge with justice: Verily how excellent is the teaching which He giveth you!

Surah 4:59,                           O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those charged with authority among you. If ye differ in anything among yourselves refer it to Allah and His Messenger if ye do believe in Allah and the Last Day: That is best and most suitable for final determination,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 4:60 ,                           Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who declare that they believe in the revelations that have come to thee and to those before thee Their (real) wish is to resort together for judgment (in their disputes) to the Evil One though they were ordered to reject him. But Satan´s wish is to lead them astray far away (from the right),Kashi wyo ta'ye cinle lo eba za nazhie la wu ke a imani jin be yanna acin be ya wyo na; to be yan na a-cin be shi wyo dzo na gancin acie wagan afea la kara'alo eba yan Dagutu (za na tswa ganmana ta Soko na ) alali ma akika ajin'a foro gan a'la'jin kafirinci be uyin shetan cie wa gan wyun'u la'ugbin egbin na ma'akpeya na.

Surah 4:63 ,              Those men-Allah knows what is in their hearts; so keep clear of them but admonish them and speak to them a word to reach their very souls,Zawuncinzhi gayi za nazhi Soko tsa kpe yannazhi fi yangban'azhio nao. Ebo acin'o a dzugan'abo wyo mao jin'a gangba wyo mao gan gan fasahazhi nazhi lukpin naofi yangban'azhio.
Surah 4:64,                      We sent not a messenger but to be obeyed in accordance with the will of Allah. If they had only when they were unjust to themselves come unto thee and asked Allah´s forgiveness and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them they would have found Allah indeed Oft-returning Most Merciful,Yima tun Tuci ndondo tuntun'a sai de ebo (ezazhi ) a la miatu'U be izini Sokoe.

Surah 4:65 ,                 But no by the Lord they can have no (real) Faith until they make thee judge in all disputes between them and find in their souls no resistance against Thy decisions but accept them with the fullest conviction.A'a Mie zhi kuti be Tsocio yin imania wun'ajin yan gaskiya'a har sai aga yedajin be hukunci wyo yin dan yan nazhi ga celeba dan tsakaniabo be dozhi-na gancin ama'a ga wo bapin ndoci dan yangban'azhio mini hukunci ndondo na wyo ga ba nao ma ama'ala kpatsun'ata'aya Soko baenio.
Surah 4:66  ,                       If We had ordered them to sacrifice their lives or to leave their homes very few of them would have done it: But if they had done what they were (actually) told it would have been best for them and would have gone farthest to strengthen their (faith);Da'aci gan be akikae Yi yiu la'ajin wajibi ta etiabo gan: Yea eti tacin'e wu ko ma yea dzun tinya dagan emiezhio da ajin wun'a sai de za de'gi minia bo.

Surah 4:68 , And We should have shown them the Straight Way,Da ma Yi ga'wuba ta eko natso yi gboro na. 
Surah 4:69 ,                All who obey Allah and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allah- of the prophets (who teach) the sincere (lovers of Truth) the witnesses (who testify) and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!,Zandondo ma na ga emitu Soko be Tuciy na to zawuncinzhi a ga'panba be za nazhi Soko twarya ni'imau ya mini Annabizhio to za na zhie dokun be gaskiya yae na be za nazhie de tsu tsu yan eri (ekundao na) be za guruzhiy.

Surah 4:70,      Such is the bounty from Allah: And sufficient is it that Allah knoweth all.Wuncin ma falala uyio dagan eba Soko Soko ma'kunke be kpikpe ndondoe.
Surah 4:71,         O ye who believe! Take your precautions and either go forth in parties or go forth all together,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! E tswa shiri yan ekun yezhi gancin yecie tin'e yae dan kun'o jama jamazhi ko ma ye' tin'eya baenio.
Surah 4:72,                There are certainly among you men who would tarry behind: If a misfortune befalls you they say: "Allah did favour us in that we were not present among them.",Akika ma ade dan mini yebo zanazhie dingun zhin zuma na. Masiba ndoci ga'a tswan ye U gan: Akika boye yan Soko ta eti mi bo ebo na midan beayin ekunda boa-na.
Surah 4:73  ,               But if good fortune comes to you from Allah they would be sure to say - as if there had never been Ties of affection between you and them - "Oh! I wish I had been with them; a fine thing should I then have made of it!",Akika ma Wyun'ayi eryatwako yan Soko ndoci yeda deo kanga wun'afe gan gan: ke wyoa gan gan bo ye ndondo dan tsakani yebo lea na: ka'sa re!

Surah 4:74,                    Let those fight in the cause of Allah Who sell the life of this world for the hereafter. To him who fighteth in the cause of Allah- whether he is slain or gets victory - Soon shall We give him a reward of great (value),Zanazhi gae kun izhe ebo ade eku na a na'akin'a gunkun'a dan eko Soko' zandondo na gae gunkun dan eko Soko'na aci Uwu na ko ma wyun'a de galaba na to be le'yin Yia ya'U la'da na wancin na.
Surah 4:75,                              And why should ye not fight in the cause of Allah and of those who being weak are ill-treated (and oppressed)- Men women and children whose cry is: "Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from thee one who will protect; and raise for us from thee one who will help!",Ki mae jin ye yeo Yecie gunkun dan eko Soko boa na'a yin'o Alali ma za nazhi a togbogun mini bagizhio to yinzagizhi to egizhi na e'gan gan: Tsoci yi!

Surah 4:76 ,                  Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah and those who reject Faith Fight in the cause of Evil: So fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan,Za nazhia imani jin na egun kun dan eko Soko za nazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na e'gunkun dan eko Dagutuo (za nae tswa ganmana ta Soko na). Ebo acin'o egun masoyi shetan zhi kun akika tanadi shetan gbogun uyio.
Surah 4:77 ,                                              Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands (from fight) but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity When (at length) the order for fighting was issued to them behold! a section of them feared men as - or even more than - they should have feared Allah: They said: "Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordered us to fight Wouldst Thou not Grant us respite to our (natural) term near (enough)" Say: "Short is the enjoyment of this world: the Hereafter is the best for those who do right: Never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least!,Kashi wyo ta ye cinle lo eba za nazhi agan ya' gan: Yea egwaezhi wandan (ke ekun lugwa) Ye mae la swallae ku kigini yemae fe'ya zakka na'a Gancin kamina abea ekun la'jin wajibi ta etiabo na sashi miniabo cie sundan zawangizhi ke dasun Soko na ko ma na gan'acin na.

Surah 4:78 ,                                  "Wherever ye are death will find you out even if ye are in towers built up strong and high!" If some good befalls them they say "This is from Allah"; but if evil they say "This is from thee" (O Prophet). Say: "All things are from Allah." But what hath come to these people that they fail to understand a single fact,Ban dondo na ye ga da dan na tsutsu'a tsun'e bagao kadama yega'fe gun mini ekpakozhio na'atu tsankuy lo sama na. Alheri ndoci ma ga'a dea a'gan gan: "Nana eba Soko bo ufe beo" Egun ndoci maga tswan'a agan gan: Nana eba wyoe bo ufe beo' Gan gan: "kpata eba Soko boa fe beo". To ki-ma jin za nana zhi acie jin fahimta egan'a yan'o.
Surah 4:79 ,                Whatever good (O man!) happens to thee is from Allah; but whatever evil happens to thee is from thy (own) soul. and We have sent thee as a messenger to (instruct) mankind. And enough is Allah for a witness,Yandondo na ga tswan wye yan alhe'ri na dagan eba Soko bo' yan na ma ga tswan wye yan egun na dagan eba wyotso bo ufe beo Yi ma tun wyo tuntun wyo lao fe Tuci (Soko) lo eba zawangizhi. Soko ma'a kunke Etsu eri.
Surah 4:80 ,          He who obeys the Messenger obeys Allah: But if any turn away We have not sent thee to watch over their (evil deeds),Zandondo naga emitu Tuci na akika wyun'a emitu Soko dan'o na za na ma ga zuma zheta na to Yi tun wyo tun fia gan wyo feo tswa'ao za'a.
Surah 4:81,                       They have "Obedience" on their lips; but when they leave thee a section of them Meditate all night on things very different from what thou tellest them. But Allah records their nightly (plots): So keep clear of them and put thy trust in Allah and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs,Acia fe gan gan: "Yi gwo yima' emitu". Gancin aga tinya dagan eba wyobo sashi miniabo a da le le be yandoci- dan yangban'o na'a ce leba natso wyo gan na.

Surah 4:82 ,          Do they not consider the Qur´an (with care) Had it been from other Than Allah they would surely have found therein Much discrepancy,Kashi e'kpaye nashidu nakpa dan alamari Alkuranu boa da' wun'ayi eba zandoci najin sokoa na bo ufe beo daatsun cice lebazhi dokun fi miniubo.Surah 4:83                             When there comes to them some matter touching (Public) safety or fear they divulge it. If they had only referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them the proper investigators would have Tested it from them (direct). Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of Allah unto you all but a few of you would have fallen into the clutches of Satan.Alamari ndoci maga beya'a yan aminci ko ma yan dansun ajin afe da ga'u miba za. Da'aci gan'u kuda eba Tuci (Soko) to eba za nazhi ala alamarizhi fiagwao miniabo na da'zanazhi gwoyin a wa dudugi wun'aza na a kpe kendoe ugayi na. Kagan umajin ebo falala Soko be yegun'uyin na ta eti yebo na'a da yega 'mitu shetan sai de'gi miniebo.
Surah 4:84   ,                  Then fight in Allah´s cause - Thou art held responsible only for thyself - and rouse the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the Unbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment,Ebo acin'o fe gun kun ta eti eko Soko a ma'ala kpakp ndoci a ta wyo ya'a sai yan eti tacin wyotso. Wyo ma'oya Muminizhi kwadari. Kengi uyio na Soko'a kangwa egun kafirizhi na Soko ma gbota gan eba egun la tswan zao. Soko ma gbota gan eba azaba jin'o.
Surah 4:85 ,                    Whoever recommends and helps a good cause becomes a partner therein: And whoever recommends and helps an evil cause shares in its burden: And Allah hath power over all things,Zandondo na ga tangwa ya za gwatan wangi na wyuntso'ade robo miniubo zandondo na ma ga tangwa ya za gwatan dede na tsunwan ndoci a danbo yan wuntso mini'ubo ma. Soko ma'afe Etsu nae dan lokaci kangi ta eti yandondo na.
Surah 4:86 ,            When a (courteous) greeting is offered you meet it with a greeting still more courteous or (at least) of equal courtesy. Allah takes careful account of all things,Ama ga be ci saye mi be emisa ndociy to ye' sa'aega be natso ga gyegan wuncin na ko ma e' sa'aga be iri natso a saye na. Akika Soko'afe Etsu nae la lisafi eti yandondo na.
Surah 4:87  ,              Allah! There is no god but He: of a surety He will gather you together against the Day of Judgment about which there is no doubt. And whose word can be truer than Allah´s,Soko ade Tsoci ndocia sai wyin' akika Ugae kuyekan da ' Efo Alkiyami kelo kezhin ndondo ma dan mini'uboa. Zi-ma ta gaskiya a gan Soko eba labari ya bo.
Surah 4:88  ,                   Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites Allah hath upset them for their (evil) deeds. Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way never shalt thou find the Way,To ki-jin ye yeo dan mini alamari munafikizhibo har yecia sa fi ena gubao alali ma Sokoa'gbin'ani ebo woce dede naa ce nao Kashi ye' wawa gan ye'la za na Sokoagbin nae lae ke eko Zandondo na ma Soko gaubgin na eko ndoci ke yaU bea.
Surah 4:89 ,                          They but wish that ye should reject Faith as they do and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks,E'jin gan ye' laejin kafirinci kendoe ajin kafirinci na ebo ye' laezhe ye'ni.

Surah 4:90 ,                                  Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty (of peace) or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. If Allah had pleased He could have given them power over you and they would have fought you: Therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not and (instead) send you (Guarantees of) peace then Allah Hath opened no way for you (to war against them),Sai de za nazhi ga'ada gun be jama'a ndocizhi-na nazhi-ma tsakani yebo bea yin alkawali danbo na ko ma za nazhi gabe eba ye be yangban wiwanci' na ke aya'a gun ye kun'a ama'a gun to zaba'a tsozhi kun'a na.

Surah 4:91,                              Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that of their people: Every time they are sent back to temptation they succumb thereto: if they withdraw not from you nor give you (guarantees) of peace besides restraining their hands seize them and slay them wherever ye get them: In their case We have provided you with a clear argument against them,Ye ma'ke' tsun zandocizhi be e'wa gan ye' ya'a aminci ye mae ya jama'a yan'azhi edunfe yan aminci.

Surah 4:92,                                                           Never should a believer kill a believer; but (If it so happens) by mistake (Compensation is due): If one (so) kills a believer it is ordained that he should free a believing slave and pay compensation to the deceased´s family unless they remit it freely. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you and he was a believer the freeing of a believing slave (Is enough). If he belonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance compensation should be paid to his family and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means (is prescribed) a fast for two months running: by way of repentance to Allah: for Allah hath all knowledge and all wisdom,Uma gwoyin na Muminizhi (muslumi) a wu Mumini na'a sai de eti bicicin'o.

Surah 4:93,              If a man kills a believer intentionally his recompense is Hell to abide therein (For ever): And the wrath and the curse of Allah are upon him and a dreadful penalty is prepared for him,Zandondo nama ga Musulumi wu digangae nato egagba'u yi Ena Jahanama bagabo wyun'a gun tutunyin'o Soko ma'azhe wun be'u yin uma'U bo''mi Uma shiri jin kau yan azaba na wancin na.
Surah 4:94,                                      O ye who believe! When ye go abroad in the cause of Allah investigate carefully and say not to any one who offers you a salutation: "Thou art none of a believer!" Coveting the perishable goods of this life: with Allah are profits and spoils abundant. Even thus were ye yourselves before till Allah conferred on you His favours: Therefore carefully investigate. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Yega tinya dan ezan'o eti ekun gun dan eko soko e wa bayani za sarauyin ye mae ga gan be zandondo na gajin ye sallama gan: wyo jin Musulumia ma.

Surah 4:95 ,                               Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward,Za nazhi fedun'azhizhi mini Musulumizhio aci lo ekun gunzhia naUmayi be uzuri kpoki yin'a na a jin ye'ni be za nazhie gun kun dan eko Soko be dukiya'azhi to be rayiazhi na laa ta eti za nazhi zhizhi na be daraja na wancin nae.

Surah 4:97,                          When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls they say: "In what (plight) Were ye" They reply: "Weak and oppressed Were we in the earth." They say: "Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to move yourselves away (From evil)" Such men will find their abode in Hell- What an evil refuge! ,Akika za nazhi Malaikazhie gwo rayiazhi na alali ma a fe dan hali yan za nazhia eti tacin'a jin gun na acie gan gan: "Hali kici ye dan'y ninbo" Acim gan: "Yi ya 'fe za nazhi a to gbogun fi kinbo na" Aci gan: "Asa kin yan Soko ujin gwugwo cia na ye'a kpela fi bo na'a" To zawuncinzhi ezhe keba'a yi Ena Jahannama.

Surah 4:98 ,          Except those who are (really) weak and oppressed - men women and children - who have no means in their power nor (a guide-post) to their way,Sai de zanazhi aga'a la to gbogun mini bagizhio to yinzagizhi to egizhi nama ade dabara ndondoa ama kpe eko ndoci ye na'ada na'a na.
Surah 4:99,         For these there is hope that Allah will forgive: For Allah doth blot out (sins) and forgive again and again.Zawuncizhi kengi uyio na Sokoa fa beayin na. Soko'ma wyun'afe Etsu fifa Etsu gafara.
Surah 4:100 ,                             He who forsakes his home in the cause of Allah finds in the earth Many a refuge wide and spacious: Should he die as a refugee from home for Allah and His Messenger His reward becomes due and sure with Allah: And Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Zandondo na gae kpela dan eko Soko na wyun'a tsun ebazhi na dokun na fi kinbo ganni be bagwae.

Surah 4:101,                      When ye travel through the earth there is no blame on you if ye shorten your prayers for fear the Unbelievers May attack you: For the Unbelievers are unto you open enemies,Ye ma gabea lodan ezan'o ta kin bo to le'fi danbo ya ye na ye ga (raka'a) swallazhi ke na'a ye gae sundan gan kafirizhi a'jin ye fitina na.

And let the other party come up which hath not yet prayed - and let them pray with thee Taking all precaution and bearing arms: the Unbelievers wish if ye were negligent of your arms and your baggage to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if ye put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because ye are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the Unbelievers Allah hath prepared a humiliating punishment,Wyo ma ga'afe dan miniabo a swalla ku gikini bea yin to kansan ndoci miniabo abea gikini be wyo yin ama'ala gwa'asun kaya 'kun'azhi.

Surah 4:103,                   When ye pass (Congregational) prayers celebrate Allah´s praises standing sitting down or lying down on your sides; but when ye are free from danger set up Regular Prayers: For such prayers are enjoined on believers at stated times,Gancin yega bea swallah jin zo to e fe'tun Soko ye gbaro bao to edunfe bao to kamina yega kansan yezhi cici na.

Surah 4:106,      But seek the forgiveness of Allah; for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.Wyo mao wa gafara Soko. Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 4:107,             Contend not on behalf of such as betray their own souls; for Allah loveth not one given to perfidy and crime,Wyo mao ga gbo'mi ya za nazhie jin eti tacin'a ha'inci na ma. Akika Sokoe wa zanae dokun be ha'inci jin'y na'a Umae wa za nae dokun be le'fi jin'y na'a.
Surah 4:108 ,                   They may hide (Their crimes) from men but they cannot hide (Them) from Allah seeing that He is in their midst when they plot by night in words that He cannot approve: And Allah Doth compass round all that they do,A' jin afe' wa gna'a swoa ya zawangizhi amae wa gan a swo'a ya sokoa ala'li ma Soko dan beayin lokaci na afe lele be yannazhi Soko jin yeda be yin'a na dan yangban'o na mae gan tinya na.

Surah 4:109,                 Ah! These are the sort of men on whose behalf ye may contend in this world; but who will contend with Allah on their behalf on the Day of Judgment or who will carry their affairs through,Ye ga dan nao ye gayi za nazhie gbo mi ya'a dan edunfe izhebo na to zidanbo na'agbomi ya'a Efo Alkiyami nao Kashi zia gikini yan wakili yaao.
Surah 4:110,            If any one does evil or wrongs his own soul but afterwards seeks Allah´s forgiveness he will find Allah Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Zandondo na ma ga lo 'tun dede na ko ma ucia eti tacin'u jin zwalunci na gancin uci wa gafara Soko wyun'a tsun Soko Etsu gafara Etsu yegun.
Surah 4:111,          And if any one earns sin. he earns it against His own soul: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom,Zandondo na ma ga da cewo zunubi na to eti tacin'u tsa wyun'e ce yao (uma'wu yan yau). Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 4:112 ,            But if any one earns a fault or a sin and throws it on to one that is innocent He carries (on himself) (Both) a falsehood and a flagrant sin,Zandondo na ma ga da cewo bibici na ko ma yan le'fi na gancin Uci dau ce ta zana yandotoa nato akika wyun'a kara yan ganmana tswitswaci la ganni be le'fi na'a tula na.
Surah 4:113,                                But for the Grace of Allah to thee and his Mercy a party of them would certainly have plotted to lead thee astray. But (in fact) they will only Lead their own souls astray and to thee they can do no harm in the least. For Allah hath sent down to thee the Book and wisdom and taught thee what thou Knewest not (before): And great is the Grace of Allah unto thee,Ka'ujinmebo falala yan Soko na ta eti wyo bo be yegun'U yin na'a da ndocizhi a jin kokari gan a la wyo ya'agbin.

Surah 4:114,                         In most of their secret talks there is no good: But if one exhorts to a deed of charity or justice or conciliation between men (Secrecy is permissible): To him who does this seeking the good pleasure of Allah We shall soon give a reward of the highest (value),Alheri ndondo dan mini kundondo yan ezaba swiswociazhi boa sai de yan za na gae jin foro be sadaka jin'y na ko jin jin yan alheri na ko ma gyara jin tsakani zawangizhio na.

Surah 4:115 ,                  If anyone contends with the Messenger even after guidance has been plainly conveyed to him and follows a path other than that becoming to men of Faith We shall leave him in the path he has chosen and land him in Hell- what an evil refuge!,Zaeni ndondo na ga'ce leba Tuci (Soko) na baci na bawu'a tula ya wyun'a ni na uci da 'mi tu eko ndoci na jin yan Muminizhia'na Yi ga'u ya dan yan-na wyuntso tsa gan wyun'a dan be yin nae Yi ci ga'u la'dan ena Jahannamao.

Surah 4:118,       Allah did curse him but he said: "I will take of Thy servants a portion Marked off,Soko ma'u bo 'mi. Uci gan akika miga jama'a mini wuzhi wyozhio na ekundoa yi bibaci na la'adin dan egbin'o. 
Surah 4:119,                    "I will mislead them and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle and to deface the (fair) nature created by Allah." Whoever forsaking Allah takes satan for a friend hath of a surety suffered a loss that is manifest,Akika ma miga'agbin mima ga guri kwarwa ladan'a yangban'azhio mi ma'ajin'a foro gan a la tukpa dab azhia ko'a ya (dabba nazhie la wo kutizhi na) akika mia jin'a foro ebo ala alitta Sokoa zhegba. Akika zandondo na ga sheitan la eya maci ke Soko lugwa na akika wyun'ajin hasara hasara na ma'atula na.
Surah 4:120,      Satan makes them promises and creates in them false desires; but satan´s promises are nothing but deception,Wyun'e jin'a alkawali Umae la guri kwarwazhi dan'a umade alkawali ndondo bea yin'a sai de eta.
Surah 4:121,      They (his dupes) will have their dwelling in Hell and from it they will find no way of escape,Za wuncinzhiezhe keba'a gayi Jahannamao ama'ade yandoci na'agan'agwa ke'u lugwa na'a.
Surah 4:122,                   But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness- we shall soon admit them to gardens with rivers flowing beneath-to dwell therein for ever. Allah´s promise is the truth and whose word can be truer than Allah´s, Za nazhi ma imani jin na acie lo 'tun wangizhi na Yi ga'la gandan Aljannazhio nazhi nuwan eduzhi'eje fi takoabo na ama'afi bo fi tutunyin wuncin ma alkawali Soko uyio na yi gaskiya na. Ziy ma fe eza gaskiya eba egan'o a gan Soko.
Surah 4:123 ,                  Not your desires nor those of the People of the Book (can prevail): whoever works evil will be requited accordingly. Nor will he find besides Allah any protector or helper,Ujin guri yezhi ko guri yan za ba Litafizhi tsa'ala tua zandondo na ga lo 'tun dede na a gaugba be'uyin ama'ade zandoci zuma Soko na'afe Ndakata yau na'a uma'ade za na'ajin'u taimako na'a.
Surah 4:124 ,              If any do deeds of righteousness- be they male or female - and have faith they will enter Heaven and not the least injustice will be done to them,Zaeni ndondo na ga lo 'tun wangi wangizhi na dagan mini bagio ko yinzagio alali ma uyi Mumini na to za wuncinzhi gaa gadan Aljannao ama'ajin'a zwaluncia konbe gwargwado yan kpara donbina'a.
Surah 4:125 ,               Who can be better in religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah does good and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith For Allah did take Abraham for a friend,Zi-ma adini jin'u ga gyegan yan za na'a fuska'u (yandondou) baenio la'aya Soko nao umayi za nae jin bolobolo na uma kezhea emi la tu ekpa yan Ibrahima na'a pan baenio zhin eko gaskiya nao Soko ma'a Ibrahima la ezamanci.
Surah 4:126 ,          But to Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth: And He it is that Encompasseth all things,Soko ga ma wun mulki yannazhi fi samazhio to nazhi fi kinbo nao Soko ma'afe Etsu na'a yandondo makezhe na.
Surah 4:127,                                       They ask thy instruction concerning the women say: Allah doth instruct you about them: And (remember) what hath been rehearsed unto you in the Book concerning the orphans of women to whom ye give not the portions prescribed and yet whom ye desire to marry as also concerning the children who are weak and oppressed: that ye stand firm for justice to orphans. There is not a good deed which ye do but Allah is well-acquainted therewith,A mae gbin wyo gan eti hukunci yinzagizhio. Gan gan: Soko'otsoa kpe eganzhi ye ya ye eti hukunci yinzagizhio to nazhi mae gba ya ye dagan mini Litafio eti ekungi yinzagizhio na nazhi ye la'ala egun'azhi ya'a ye mae de shahawa yan yawojin bea yin na. To hukunci egi wawagizhi nazhia to gbogun na be kini na yeagi ya ekungizhi be adalinci-na .Yandondo na ma ye ga jin yan alhe'ri na akika Soko yi be kpikpe u yin.
Surah 4:128,                            If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband´s part there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves; and such settlement is best; even though men´s souls are swayed by greed. But if ye do good and practise self-restraint Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Yinzagi gabea fe gan wyun'e sundan yan eyewu ko zuma zheta dagan eba eba'ubo le'fi danboa na a wa gyara tsakaniabo be dozhi naa uga de alheri gan'o. Ama yanbotan la'shi yangban zawangi zhio. Amma ye ga'fe yecie jin bolobolo yecie sundan Soko (wuncin gye gan) akika ma Soko a fe Etsu nayi be labari etun nazhi ye'lo kpata na.
Surah 4:129 ,                    Ye are never able to be fair and just as between women even if it is your ardent desire: But turn not away (from a woman) altogether so as to leave her (as it were) hanging (in the air). If ye come to a friendly understanding and practise self-restraint Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Ye ma'jin adalinci wo tsakani yinzagizhi boa (eba cin cin yan yangban'o) ka ye ga bavun yan jin jin acin. Ebo acin'o yega'a pan pinpan yan baeni ke ndoci lugwa ma ye cia la wyun'e lugwa ke yan na ala ban ebao na. (a ya wyun'a ama la'jin anfania). Ye ma ga jin bolobolo ye ci sundan Soko to akika Soko afe Etsu gafara Etsu yegun.
Surah 4:130 ,         But if they disagree (and must part) Allah will provide abundance for all from His all-reaching bounty: for Allah is He that careth for all and is Wise,A ma ga bea gan be dozhiy Soko ajin bagwo ya zaeni ndondo miniabo dagan mini bagwo arzikiubo. Soko ma Etsu bagwo uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 4:131,                               To Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth. Verily we have directed the People of the Book before you and you (o Muslims) to fear Allah. But if ye deny Him lo! unto Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth and Allah is free of all wants worthy of all praise.Soko ga ma wun mulki yan yannazhi fi samazhio nao to nazhi fi kinbo nao. Akika ma Yi jin waswinci ya za nazhiala Litafi ya shi yedzo na to yetso ma ke de ye' sundan Soko na ye ma ga beajin kafirinci to akika Soko ga wun mulki yannazhi fi samazhio to nazhi fi kinbo nao. Soko ma wyun'afe Etsu bagwo arziki Etsu na yandondo e'jin yebo ya na.
Surah 4:132,         Yea unto Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth and enough is Allah to carry through all affairs,Soko ga ma wun mulki yan yannazhi fi samao nao to nazhi fi kinbo na. Soko maakunke na zandondo a yakpe na.
Surah 4:133,           If it were His will He could destroy you o mankind and create another race; for He hath power this to do,Uga ba'U Ugae fin ya baenio ya ye zawangizhi! Ucia be yan'U be za worozhiy. Soko ma Etsu na gboka na uyio eti jinjin acin'o.
Surah 4:134,             If any one desires a reward in this life in Allah´s (gift) is the reward (both) of this life and of the hereafter: for Allah is He that heareth and seeth (all things),Zandondo na gae kpa egagba yan izhe (be etun'yin na) Soko yibe egagba yan izhe to yan ekuy. Soko ma'afe Etsu nae wo yandondo na Etsu nae le yandondo ye na.
Surah 4:135 ,                                   O ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice as witnesses to Allah even as against yourselves or your parents or your kin and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for Allah can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts) lest ye swerve and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice verily Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ye'a fe zanazhia kugikini be adalinci- na ye lae fe eri jincizhi ebo Soko ka wun'ayi eti yetsobo ko ma yanmancizhi ko ma dangi yan tsonbazhi ko eti za na yi eyandeci nao ko ma talaka Soko de gan'a kpata ebo acin'o ega la ;mi tu etun yangban ma kacin'a ye ga pan ke gaskiya lugwa. Ye ma ga gangan na'pan ke gaskiya lugwa na ko ma ye ci navo ci jin gaskiya'a to akika Soko Etsu uyio na yi be labari etun nazhi ye'lo na.
Surah 4:136 ,                          O ye who believe! Believe in Allah and His Messenger and the scripture which He hath sent to His Messenger and the scripture which He sent to those before (him). Any who denieth Allah His angels His Books His Messengers and the Day of Judgment hath gone far far astray,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Yea imani jin (wangi) be Sokoe to be Tuci'U yin to be Litafi na ucin be ya Tuci'U na to be Litafi na u cin be shidzona. Zandondo na ga jin kafirinci be Sokoe na to Malaikauzhi to Tuciuzhi to Efo yan zobae na akika za wuncin'a gbin egbin na ma lokpa sarauyin na.
Surah 4:137   ,                Those who believe then reject faith then believe (again) and (again) reject faith and go on increasing in unbelief- Allah will not forgive them nor guide them nor guide them on the way,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci na gancin aci kezhea imani jin aci kezhe jin kafirinci gancin kezhea be ta eti kafirinci jin'o na Soko fe Etsu na'ajin'a gafara na'a U ma'a la'ake eko gurua.
Surah 4:138,     To the Hypocrites give the glad tidings that there is for them (but) a grievous penalty;-La bushara ya munafikizhi kede' akaika azaba na tan sarauyin na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a. (Bushara= labari).
Surah 4:139 ,            Yea to those who take for friends unbelievers rather than believers: is it honour they seek among them Nay- all honour is with Allah,Za nazhie da la kafirizhi eya mancizhi ke Muminizhi lugwa na be ke' e'wa zankpe ndoci wa za dagan gwata'abo na Ngan akika zankpe kpata eba Soko bou dan'o.
Surah 4:140,                                Already has He sent you Word in the Book that when ye hear the signs of Allah held in defiance and ridicule ye are not to sit with them unless they turn to a different theme: if ye did ye would be like them. For Allah will collect the hypocrites and those who defy faith - all in Hell,Akika ma Soko cin be ya ye dan mini Litafio kede' ye gae be wo aya yan Soko zhi acie jin kafirinci bea yin acie la 'mi bea yin ye'ga fedun beayin kanga be ma sai aga bea lo dan eza ndoci najin wuncin'a na. Akika ye ga fedun bea yin kanga yega'azhe dozhin'a (eba lefio). Akika Soko ga munafikizhi to kafirizhi kpata ku yekan fi ena Jahannamao.
Surah 4:141,                                   (These are) the ones who wait and watch about you: if ye do gain a victory from Allah they say: "Were we not with you"- but if the unbelievers gain a success they say (to them): "Did we not gain an advantage over you and did we not guard you from the believers" but Allah will judge betwixt you on the Day of Judgment. And never will Allah grant to the unbelievers a way (to triumphs) over the believers,Za nazhie la 'ye tu ye yanna ga'tswan ye na harma nasara ndoci ga'ade ye dagan eba soko agan: Asa ujin be yeyin ga yi dan'a Uma'a yi kafirizhi ga-be de rabo ndocio agan: Asa yi zan ye kpea Yi ma ke' kangwa ya ye be Muminizhi yin'a To Soko ga hukunci jin tsakaniebo be dozhiy Efo Alkiyamiy Soko ma'ala kagbo ya kafirizhi ta eti Muminizhi boa.
Surah 4:142,                  The Hypocrites - they think they are over-reaching Allah but He will over-reach them: When they stand up to prayer they stand without earnestness to be seen of men but little do they hold Allah in remembrance,Akika munafikizhi ajin afe' ta Soko (eba yekpaabo) alali ma Soko ga'a wo gbata be etaazhiy kamina aga' nakin da jin swalla na e'nakin na be nakan gban'e. E'jin jin ebo zawangizhia leye amae pa Sokoa sai de'gi.
Surah 4:143,               (They are) distracted in mind even in the midst of it- being (sincerely) for neither one group nor for another whom Allah leaves straying- never wilt thou find for him the way,Ceka celozhin zhi ayio dan tacin wuncin bo' adan mini zannazhio loloa Ama dan mini zan nazhio loloa.Zandondo na Soko gaU gbin na wyoade eko (guru) ndoci la yau bea.
Surah 4:144 ,               O ye who believe! Take not for friends unbelievers rather than believers: Do ye wish to offer Allah an open proof against yourselves,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la kafirizhi masoyizhi ke Muminizhi lugwa ma. Kashi ye' wawa gan ye'la dalili yan gbangbae lae wu Soko na Uga wan ye na.
Surah 4:145,          The Hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire: no helper wilt thou find for them,Akika munafikizhi afi mini tako yan gushe na gba gan mini enao na. wyo ma'ade taimako jinci ndondo ya'a.
Surah 4:146 ,                Except for those who repent mend (their lives) hold fast to Allah and purify their religion as in Allah´s sight: if so they will be (numbered) with the believers. And soon will Allah grant to the believers a reward of immense value,Sai de za nazhi ga tuba jin acia miniazhi yejin acia 'gwasun bawu Soko acia edzuta la'adan jin jin adinio ebo Soko to  za wuncinzhi dan mini Muminizhio Soko ma'ala egagba na wancin na ya Muminizhi.
Surah 4:147,          What can Allah gain by your punishment if ye are grateful and ye believe Nay it is Allah that recogniseth (all good) and knoweth all things,Ki-yi yan na Soko de dajin (yan anfani) be azaba jin ye yin nao ye ga'fe eza yebojinzhi yeci kezhea imani jin nao Soko ma'afe Etsu yebojin Etsu kpikpe.
Surah 4:148 ,            Allah loveth not that evil should be noised abroad in public speech except where injustice hath been done; for Allah is He who heareth and knoweth all things,Sokoe wa lilatu yan eyan dede mini eganboa sai de za na ga jin'u zwalunci na. Soko ma'afe Etsu nae wo yandondo na Etsu kpikpe.
Surah 4:149 ,            Whether ye publish a good deed or conceal it or cover evil with pardon verily Allah doth blot out (sins) and hath power (in the judgment of values),Ye ga alheri la'tu ko ma yeci'uswo ko ma yeci fa be le'fi egun na'jin ye na (egagba yandondo dan be Sokoe) Akika ma Sokoa fe Etsu nae fa na Etsu na de iko ta eti yandondo na.
Surah 4:151,       They are in truth (equally) unbelievers; and we have prepared for unbelievers a humiliating punishment,Za wuncinzhi ga yi kafirizhi yan haki kao yi ma' shiri jin ya kafirizhi yan azaba yan zunyesun.
Surah 4:152 ,               To those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction between any of the messengers we shall soon give their (due) rewards: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Za nazhi-ma a imani jin be Sokoe ganni be TuciUzhi-na ama la erikpe ndoci dan tsakania boa na za wuncinzhi be le'yin aga egagba'a la'aya Soko ma'afe Etsu gafara Etsu yegun.
Surah 4:153,                                    The people of the Book ask thee to cause a book to descend to them from heaven: Indeed they asked Moses for an even greater (miracle) for they said: "Show us Allah in public" but they were dazed for their presumption with thunder and lightning. Yet they worshipped the calf even after clear signs had come to them; even so we forgave them; and gave Moses manifest proofs of authority,Jama'a nazhi'ala Litafi ya na e'gbin wyo gan gan wyo'ocin Litafi ndocio ya'a dagan samao. Akika agbin Musa gan yan yan na gbota gan acin na leani aci gan: "La Soko wu yi gbangbae yi- le'u ye'. Kabara yan sanma cia wan ebo zwalunci na'ajin na gancin acia nanko gigi la cie jin bauta ya baci na hujjazhi nazhia tula dabe ya'a ni na. yicia fa be wuncin'y Yicia dalili na'atula na la'ya Musa.Surah 4:154                  And for their covenant we raised over them (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai); and (on another occasion) we said: "Enter the gate with humility"; and (once again) we commanded them: "Transgress not in the matter of the sabbath." And we took from them a solemn covenant.Yicia pati yan Turu la'aketo ta fitiabo ebo alkawaliabo yi ma gan ya'gan: "Yea gandan eko be ekpyade" Yi ci ke gan 'a gan; "Ega kara gwo iyaka gan dan Asibio ma" Yi ma gwo alkawali na lekpan na dagan eba'abo.
Surah 4:155 ,                    (They have incurred divine displeasure): In that they broke their covenant; that they rejected the signs of Allah; that they slew the Messengers in defiance of right; that they said "Our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve Allah´s Word; We need no more)";- Nay Allah hath set the seal on their hearts for their blasphemy and little is it they believe,Ebo luloya yan alkawaliazhi be kafirincia yin be aya Soko zhi be wuwu Annabizhi na jin eti hakki ndondo boa na be egan nazhie dagan gan; "Yangban'azhi' a yaba (wun'atsu) A'a Soko dea yangban'azhi te-ebo kafirinci naejin nao. Ebo acin'o ajin imani'a sai de'gi.
Surah 4:156,    That they rejected Faith; that they uttered against Mary a grave false charge,To ebo kafirincio to egan na'agan eti Maryamuo na yi ganmana tswitswaci gbonta na.
Surah 4:157,                                 That they said (in boast) "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary the Messenger of Allah";- but they killed him not nor crucified him but so it was made to appear to them and those who differ therein are full of doubts with no (certain) knowledge but only conjecture to follow for of a surety they killed him not,To gingan na'agan gan: "Yi yia Isa egi Maryamu na yi Tuci Soko na wu" alali ma a wu wyun'a ama fo'u sa' amma'a a eza la'abeu fia. Akika ma za nazhi- ce dozhi leba eti alamariubo na e'jin kelokezhin dan miniubo ade hakika yan kpikpe etiuboa sai de yekpa nae la 'mi tu na a ma wu'u eba hakika boa.
Surah 4:158,       Nay Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power Wise,A' a Soko'Ula da fiti lo eba wyuntso Soko ma'afe Etsu kpikpe Etsu hikima.
Surah 4:159             And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment he will be a witness against them,Ama de zandondo dan mini za ba Litafi zhi boa sai na wyun'a gaskiya ya be uyin shidzo be'dzo ka fi'ujin ajali na Efo Alkiyami'ima uga'afe eri ta etiabo.
Surah 4:160             For the iniquity of the Jews We made unlawful for them certain (foods) good and wholesome which had been lawful for them;- in that they hindered many from Allah´s Way,To ebo zwalunci na fe be gwata Yahuduzhio na Yi yia yangici managi managizhi la'ajin haramu ya'a nazhi-ma halali ayi ya'ao na to ebo kinkan kanma nae kan zawangizhi ezanda ta eti eko Soko na.
Surah 4:161 ,            That they took usury though they were forbidden; and that they devoured men´s substance wrongfully;- we have prepared for those among them who reject faith a grievous punishment,To ewo yan riba(ewo nuwan) nae gwo na alali ma'a kan jin jin wuncin leani to ewo zazhi nae giayan eti ganmanao na. Yi ma shiri jin ya kafirizhi miniabo yan azaba nayi tintanci na.
Surah 4:162 ,                       But those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge and the believers believe in what hath been revealed to thee and what was revealed before thee: And (especially) those who establish regular prayer and practise regular charity and believe in Allah and in the Last Day: To them shall We soon give a great reward,Amma'ade za nazhia shidu dan kpikpeo miniabo na to Muminizhi a imani jin be yanna acin be shi wyo dzo nae. To zanazhi mae ku swalla gikini na to za nazhie wa zakka na to zanzhia imani jin be Sokoe to Efo zobae na za wuncinzhi kpata yia la egagba na wancin na ya'a.
Surah 4:163,                        We have sent thee inspiration as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham Isma´il Isaac Jacob and the Tribes to Jesus Job Jonah Aaron and solomon and to David We gave the Psalms,Akika  yi jin wahyi be ya wyoe dozhin kendoe Yi jin wahyi be ya Nuhu na to Annabizhi nazhi be zumaubona. Yima ke'jin wahyi ya Ibrahima to Isma'ila to Ishaqa to Yakuba to yagizhi to Isa to Ayuba to Yunusa to Haruna to Sulaimanu Yima la Litafi zabura ya Dawuda.
Surah 4:164,             Of some messengers We have already told thee the story; of others We have not;- and to Moses Allah spoke direct,To Tuci ndocizhi danbo Yia labariazhi la ya wyoe le'ani Tuci ndocizhi ma danbo Yi la labariazhi ya wyo ya'a Soko ma gangan be Musae egan yan hakika.
Surah 4:165,              Messengers who gave good news as well as warning that mankind after (the coming) of the messengers should have no plea against Allah: For Allah is Exalted in Power Wise,Tucizhi ayio e'ya labari yangban fazhi a mayi za nazhie na wun na ebo zawangizhi'a gade hujjandondo ta eti Soko-ma baci na wyun'a Tucizhi tuntun'ani na. Soko ma'afe Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima.
Surah 4:166  ,          But Allah beareth witness that what He hath sent unto thee He hath sent from His (own) knowledge and the angels bear witness: But enough is Allah for a witness,Amma'ade Soko'otso ejin 'ri be yanna Ucin ya wyo na Ucin'ucin be kpikpe Uyin Malaikazhio tsoejin ri Soko'otso ma'kun Eri.
Surah 4:167,          Those who reject Faith and keep off (men) from the way of Allah have verily strayed far far away from the Path,Akika zanazhi'ajin kafirinci na aci kan zawangizhi 'zan ta eti eko Soko na akika zawuncinzhi'a gbin egbin na ma' kpeya na.
Surah 4:168,           Those who reject Faith and do wrong- Allah will not forgive them nor guide them to any way,Akika za nazhi-jin kafirinci na a ma jin zwalunci na Ufe yanna gwoyin ya Soko na wyun'a jin'a gafara na'a Uma gwoyin na wyun'a wuaba ta eko gboro na'a.
Surah 4:169 ,         Except the way of Hell to dwell therein for ever. And this to Allah is easy,Sai de eko yan Jahannama baga bo ma'afi tutun yin'o. wuncin ma eyan fifanci uyi ya Soko.
Surah 4:170 ,                     O Mankind! The Messenger hath come to you in truth from Allah: believe in him: It is best for you. But if ye reject Faith to Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth: And Allah is All-knowing All-wise,Ya ye zawangizhi! Akika Tuci (Soko) dabe yaye be gaskiyae dagan eba Tsoci yebo ebo acin'o yea imani jin wuncin fe alhe'ri yaye gan.

Surah 4:171,                                                    O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of Allah aught but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) a messenger of Allah and His Word which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit proceeding from Him: so believe in Allah and His messengers. Say not "Trinity" : desist: it will be better for you: for Allah is one Allah: Glory be to Him: (far exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs,Ya ye za ba Litafizhi! Ega gwo iyaka gan dan mini adiniebo ma ye mae ga gangan ndondo ta Soko ma sai de nagayi gaskiya na.

Surah 40:61     ,              It is Allah Who has made the Night for you that ye may rest therein and the days as that which helps (you) to see. Verily Allah is full of Grace and Bounty to men: yet most men give no thanks.,Soko ga la yeshi ya ye yeo ebo ye debae shi yangban'e fi mini'u bo to ba'tin ebo ye fe le ba ye. Akika Soko Etsu eryatwazhi uyio ya zawangizhi amma'de ekundondo zawangizhie jin yeboa.Surah 40:62           Such is Allah your Lord the Creator of all things there is no god but He: Then how ye are deluded away from the Truth!Soko ga dan'o nao wun ga yi Tsoci ye yeo wun ga jin alitta yan yandondo a de yan nan a jin bauta ya be gaskiyae naa sai wun'y kiy be la acie la ye pan ke eko lugwao
Surah 40:63     , Thus are deluded those who are wont to reject the Signs of Allah.,Acinga ga za nanzhie gbomi be aya Soko (zhiy) nan e la pan ke eko Soko lugwao. (Ebo emi gboazhio).
Surah 40:64        ,            It is Allah Who has made for you the earth as a resting place and the sky as a canopy and has given you shape- and made your shapes beautiful- and has provided for you Sustenance of things pure and good;- such is Allah your Lord. So Glory to Allah the Lord of the Worlds!,Soko ga la kin cici ya ye ucia fe edunfe bao u cia sanmam tu gikini Ucia ye jin be tswitswa wangiy Ucia ye ya arziki wangizhi Soko ye ga dan'o nao Wun'ga yi Tsoci ye yeo.

Surah 40:66       ,            Say: "I have been forbidden to invoke those whom ye invoke besides Allah- seeing that the Clear Signs have come to me from my Lord; and I have been commanded to bow (in Islam) to the Lord of the Worlds.",Gan gan: "Akika Soko kan mi han mi'n ga jin bauta ya yannazhiy ye jin bauta ya ke Soko lugwa na ma.

Surah 40:67             ,                It is He Who has created you from dust then from a sperm-drop then from a leech-like clot; then does he get you out (into the light) as a child: then lets you (grow and) reach your age of full strength; then lets you become old- though of you there are some who die before;- and lets you reach a Term appointed; in order that ye may learn wisdom.,Soko ga jin alitta ye dagan jikannan bo gancin dagan maniybo gancin ucia zhe egya tsuntsun ci gancin aci ga ye wa tinya dzakangiy gancin ye cia bea jin ba-ligi gancin yecia bea kuku mini yebo a de nanzhiy gaa tsu shidzo nan.

Surah 40:69 ,        Seest thou not those that dispute concerning the Signs of Allah How are they turned away (from Reality)-,Wyo le za nanzhie gbomi dan mini aya Soko zhio nan ye'a Kendoe e ce'a za naa
Surah 40:70    ,    Those who reject the Book and the (revelations) with which We sent our messengers: but soon shall they know-,Za nan zhia litafi (Alkur'anu) yi ganmanan nan aci kezhea yan nanzhi yia tun Tucizhi tun nan yi ganmanan nan bele yin a be kpe.

Surah 40:72  ,   In the boiling fetid fluid: then in the Fire shall they be burned;,A' fi mini nuwan yipao a cia fi mini ena o nan a fe la din'a nan.
Surah 40:73  ,    Then shall it be said to them: "Where are the (deities) to which ye gave part-worship-,Gancin acia gan'a gan: Ba yannanzhi ye fe la pa Soko baci nan dan'o
Surah 40:74 ,               "In derogation of Allah" They will reply: "They have left us in the lurch: Nay we invoked not of old anything (that had real existence)." Thus does Allah leave the Unbelievers to stray.,Yecie wun'a ke Soko lugwa. Acia gan gan: A gbin yi yeo. A'a yi jin bauta ya yandondo lea niy. Acinga ga Sokoe gbin kafirizhio.
Surah 40:75  ,        "That was because ye were wont to rejoice on the earth in things other than the Truth and that ye were wont to be insolent.,Wuncin ma a tswan ye tswan ebo fahri banza na ye fe jin kpe eti kinbo nao be etun banza nanzhi ye fe lo nao.
Surah 40:76 ,      "Enter ye the gates of Hell to dwell therein: and evil is (this) abode of the arrogant!",E fe' gandan eko yan jahannama zhio ba ga bo yea fi tutun yin'o akika zoba yan za nanzhie lati dan fin'o nan wun'a biy.
Surah 40:77      ,       So persevere in patience; for the Promise of Allah is true: and whether We show thee (in this life) some part of what We promise them- or We take thy soul (to Our Mercy) (before that)-(in any case) it is to Us that they shall (all) return.,A ankuri jin akika alkawali Soko gaskiya uyio.

Surah 40:78             ,                  We did aforetime send messengers before thee: of them there are some whose story We have related to thee and some whose story We have not related to thee. It was not (possible) for any messenger to bring a sign except by the leave of Allah: but when the Command of Allah issued the matter was decided in truth and justice and there perished there and then those who stood on Falsehoods.,Akika Yi tun Tucizhi tun shi wyo dzo mini'abo ade nanzhi Yi ya wye labari'azhi nan ama de nanzhi yi la labariazhi ya wyo yaa nan.

Surah 40:79       , It is Allah Who made cattle for you that ye may use some for riding and some for food;,Soko ga la dabbazhi ya ye yeo ebo ye de etu mini'abo mini'abo ma ade nanzhi yea fe gi nan.
Surah 40:80   ,        And there are (other) advantages in them for you (besides); that ye may through them attain to any need (there may be) in your hearts; and on them and on ships ye are carried.,Yema de eyan anfanizhi mini'abo ebo ma ye de'a ela-ewo bukata yan yangban yezhi. Gancin eti dabba yezhio to eya nuwanzhi yea lo ebazhi wo be kara ye zhiy.
Surah 40:81   ,  And He shows you (always) His Signs: then which of the Signs of Allah will ye deny,Soko mae la ayauzhi wu ye kici mini aya Soko zhio danbo nan ye'a gbomi nao
Surah 40:82      ,                  Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them They were more numerous than these and superior in strength and in the traces (they have left) in the land: Yet all that they accomplished was of no profit to them.,Kashi e za za kpe eti kin boa kacin'a ngan a' le kendoe zoba zanazhiy shiadzo nan yiyi nan ye. Ngan za wuncinzhi dokun gan'a ama gboka gan'a ama de bazhi gan'a kpe kin bo. Etun nanzhiy ma a lo kpata na u kunke ya'a.
Surah 40:83     ,         For when their messengers came to them with Clear Signs they exulted in such knowledge (and skill) as they had; but that very (Wrath) at which they were wont to scoff hemmed them in.,Kaminan Tuciazhi be yaa be bayanizhiy nan a fe jin fahri be yannanzhiy fi bea yin mini kpikpeo nan. Yannanzhiy afe laa la-mi nan cia jin tabbata ta etiabo.
Surah 40:84        ,   But when they saw Our Punishment they said: "We believe in Allah- the one Allah - and we reject the partners we used to join with Him.",Kaminan abe le azaba Yi ye nan a gan: Yia imani jin be Sokoe gbaugi yi maajin kafirinci be yannanzhi yi fe laa pau baci nan.
Surah 40:85         ,       But their professing the Faith when they (actually) saw Our Punishment was not going to profit them. (Such has been) Allah´s Way of dealing with His Servants (from the most ancient times). And even thus did the Rejecters of Allah perish (utterly)!,Kanga imania u jin'a anfania ebo nan azaba Yi gaa a le yeo. Nan nan ekpa Soko uyio naa shidzo dan tacin wuzhiuzhio nan.

Surah 42:3   ,      Thus doth (He) send inspiration to thee as (He did) to those before thee- Allah Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom.,Acinga ga Soko Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima wun'e jin wahayi be ya wyo yao to zanazhiy shi wyo dzo nao.
Surah 42:4 ,        To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: and He is Most High Most Great.,Wyun ga wun yannanzhiy fi sanmazhio to nanzhiy fi kin bo nao wun ga ma yi Etsu elatuo Etsu cinwan'o
.Surah 42:5    ,              The heavens are almost rent asunder from above them (by Him Glory): and the angels celebrate the Praises of their Lord and pray for forgiveness for (all) beings on earth: Behold! Verily Allah is He the Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Sanmazhi atsotso ke a ga banfi dagan fitio nan (ebo edo yan cinwan Soko) Malaikazhi mae li Soko be ekundo yan yebo jin'y ya Tsocia yin amae kezhe ba gaafara ya za nanzhiy fi kinbo nan. Akika Soko ga yi Etsu gaafarao U ga ma yi Etsu yegun'o.
Surah 42:6   ,        And those who take as protectors others besides Him- Allah doth watch over them; and thou art not the disposer of their affairs.,Za nanzhiy ma a zandocizhi la ndakata ke Soko lugwa nan kpikpe yan Soko ta etiabo wyo ma jin za na'a fe tswa etun'azhi za na'a.
Surah 42:7   ,                  Thus have We sent by inspiration to thee an Arabic Qur´an: that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities and all around her- and warn (them) of the Day of Assembly of which there is no doubt: (when) some will be in the Garden and some in the Blazing Fire.,Acinga ga Yi jin wahayi Alkuranu be ya wye yo u ma yi be ezhimi Larubawae ebo wyo yo jin jama'a yan Makacizhi gangba to za nanzhiy ma'u kezhe nan (izhe kpata).

Surah 42:8        ,          If Allah had so willed He could have made them a single people; but He admits whom He will to His Mercy; and the Wrong-doers will have no protector nor helper.,Wun'a ba Soko ba da uga zawangizhi laazhe al'umma nini (eti adini ninio) amma'de wun'e la za nan ga bau nan a gandan mini yegun'u bo.

Surah 42:9  ,             What! Have they taken (for worship) protectors besides Him But it is Allah- He is the Protector and it is He Who gives life to the dead: It is He Who has power over all things,Kashi a zandocizhi la la ndakatazhi zunma Soko Ngan Soko ga yi Ndakata yan gaskiyao wun ga ma'edan eyan tsutsu cizhi rayio U ma de kagbo ta eti yandondo
Surah 42:10   ,           Whatever it be wherein ye differ the decision thereof is with Allah: such is Allah my Lord: In Him I trust and to Him I turn.,Yandondo nan ma ye ga cedozhi leba etiubo nan Ye'a hukunci la aya Soko (ebo nan wun ga wun hukunci kpatao). Soko wuncin ga yi Tsoci mi yin'o wun ga mi ya kpeo eba'u ga ma mia zheban loo.
Surah 42:11      ,            (He is) the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is nothing whatever like unto Him and He is the One that hears and sees (all things).,Soko ga yi Etsu nan jin alitta sanmazhi to kin nao.

Surah 42:12   ,         To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: He enlarges and restricts. The Sustenance to whom He will: for He knows full well all things.,Giyeko yan edzunba ko yan arziki yan sanmazhi to kin dan ba'ubo wun'e kpe gwa arziki ya za nan ga ba'unan U mae la de'gi ya za nan ga ba'u nan.

Surah 42:13               ,                      The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which We enjoined on Abraham Moses and Jesus: Namely that ye should remain steadfast in religion and make no divisions therein: to those who worship other things than Allah hard is the (way) to which thou callest them. Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him).,Sokoa sharia la cici ya ye yan adini iri nantso u lajin wahayi be ya (Annabi) Nuhu nan to nantso Yi jin wahayiu be ya wye nan to yan Ibrahima to Musa to Isa kpaata'a Yi jin'a wasiyya gan: Ye'a adini ku gikini Ye mae ga sa'kpazhi be dozhi dan mini adinio ma.

Surah 42:14  ,                           And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them- through selfish envy as between themselves. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord (tending) to a Term appointed the matter would have been settled between them: But truly those who have inherited the Book after them are in suspicious (disquieting) doubt concerning it.,A ma kpe ka-ka-yin be dozhi yin'a sai de baci nan kpikpe da be yaa zo nan ebo nanvo nandan tsakaniabo be dozhiy nan.

Surah 42:15        ,                         Now then for that (reason) call (them to the Faith) and stand steadfast as thou art commanded nor follow thou their vain desires; but say: "I believe in the Book which Allah has sent down; and I am commanded to judge justly between you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord: for us (is the responsibility for) our deeds and for you for your deeds. There is no contention between us and you. Allah will bring us together and to Him is (our) Final Goal.,Ebo acin'o fe yi zazhi (zhin eko Soko) Wyo mao laoku'o gikini kendoe Soko jin'o foro nan ga la'mi tu etun yangban'azhi ma.

Surah 42:16           ,      But those who dispute concerning Allah after He has been accepted- futile is their dispute in the Sight of their Lord: on them will be a Penalty terrible.,Za nanzhiy mae gbomi eti alamari Soko nan baci nan ekundondo zawangizhi a imani jin beu yin'a ni nan hujja yan zawuncinzhi nyi-nyi ci uyio eba Tsociabo ewunzhe yan Soko maajin tabbata ta etiabo azaba nan tan sarauyin nan wun'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 42:17   ,       It is Allah Who has sent down the Book in Truth and the Balance (by which to weigh conduct). And what will make thee realise that perhaps the Hour is close at hand,Soko ga yi Etsu nancin Litafi be be gaskiyae nao ganni be tsunwan yan gboro dae. Kiy maala kpikpe ya wyo yo ko Alkiyami a tsoba kpan kpan yin'a nio
Surah 42:18     ,                Only those wish to hasten it who believe not in it: those who believe hold it in awe and know that it is the Truth. Behold verily those that dispute concerning the Hour are far astray.,Za nanzhiy a jin imani beu yin'a nan e'din Alkiyami ye za nanzhiy ma imani jin beu yin nan e sundan'u a ma kpe wo ke gaskiya uyio nan. Akika za nanzhie jin kelo kezhin eti Alkiyamio nan a fi mini egbin naa kpe ya nan.
Surah 42:19  ,      Gracious is Allah to His servants: He gives Sustenance to whom He pleases: and He has power and can carry out His Will.,Soko Etsu yegun uyio be wuzhi'uzhiy wyun'e la arziki ya za na ga bau nan. Akika Etsu kagbo uyio Etsu zankpe Uyio.
Surah 42:20 ,                    To any that desires the tilth of the Hereafter We give increase in his tilth and to any that desires the tilth of this world We grant somewhat thereof but he has no share or lot in the Hereafter.,Zandondo nae lo tun ucie wa egagba yan Alkiyami nan Yia be'u bibe dan mini egagba'ubo za nan ma gae lo tun ebo egagba izheo nan Yia yau mini'ubo u maa de rabo ndondo efo alkiyami yin'a.
Surah 42:21   ,                  What! have they partners (in godhead) who have established for them some religion without the permission of Allah Had it not been for the Decree of Judgment the matter would have been decided between them (at once). But verily the Wrong-doers will have a grievous Penalty.,Kashi a de Tsoci ndocizhi de (baci Soko) nan la sharia cici yaa yan adini natso ma Soko yaa izini wun'a nan Akika kagan u jin ebo nan hukunci Soko a shidzoani naa da aga hukunci ba tsakani'abo (tun dagan izhe babo) Akika azaba nan tan nan wun'ajin tabbata ya azwalumizhi.
Surah 42:22  ,                     Thou wilt see the Wrong-doers in fear on account of what they have earned and (the burden of) that must (necessarily) fall on them. But those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in the luxuriant meads of the Gardens: they shall have before their Lord all that they wish for. That will indeed be the magnificent Bounty (of Allah).,Wyo'a le azwalumizhi ye a fe sundan yan egagba ded yan etun nanzhiy a lo nan U ma ga cin taa. Zananzhi maa imani jin acie lotun guru nan a fi mini bata Aljannazhio yannanzhi a gae wa kpata nan u dan be Tsocia yin. Nan nan ga yi daraja nan wancin nao.
Surah 42:23      ,                      That is (the Bounty) whereof Allah gives Glad Tidings to His Servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say: "No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin." And if any one earns any good We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Ready to appreciate (service).,Nan nan ga Sokoe la' fa wuzhi'uzhi yangban'o nanzhia imani jin amae lotun wangizhi nan Gan gan: Mi gbin ye gan egagba (yan etun nan mie lo nan boa) sai de cincin yan dangibo ( nan dan tsakani'abo nan). Zaeni ndondo nan ga lo tun wangi nan Yi'a be'u bolobolo dan mini'ubo. Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu nan e jin yebo nan uyio.
Surah 42:24    ,                 What! Do they say "He has forged a falsehood against Allah" But if Allah willed He could seal up thy heart. And Allah blots out Vanity and proves the Truth by His Words. For He knows well the secrets of all hearts.,Kashiy e gan-agn ganmanan u zun ta Soko Ngan Wun'aba Soko ba uga eyan te yangban wye Soko ma ga ganmana finya u ma ga gaskiya jin tabbata be hukunciuyin akika ude kpikpe yan yannazhi fi yangbanzhio nan.
Surah 42:25   ,        He is the One that accepts repentance from His Servants and forgives sins: and He knows all that ye do.,U mae gwo gwatan (tuba) yan wuzhi u zhi U mae fa be etun dedezhiy U ma de kpikpe yan etun nazhiy ye" lo na.
Surah 42:26     ,      And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness and gives them increase of His Bounty: but for the Unbelievers their is a terrible Penalty.,U mae gwo aduwa za nazhi ga imani jin acie lo tun wangizhi na U maa bea mini eryatwa'ubo. Kafirizhi ma azaba tsuntsun gaajin tabbata ya'a
Surah 42:27       ,         If Allah were to enlarge the provision for His Servants they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth; but he sends (it) down in due measure as He pleases. For He is with His Servants Well-acquainted Watchful.,Da'aci gan Soka ariziki kpegwa kpe ya wuzhiuzhi baenio da'aga gbotika kpe eti kinbo (aga'gwo iyaka gan) amma'de Wyun'e cin'u cin be gwargwado yan kendoe ga bau na. Akika Soko de labari yan na wuzhi uzhi fi'y ninbo na U mae cin'a le.
Surah 42:28  ,          He is the One that sends down rain (even) after (men) have given up all hope and scatters His Mercy (far and wide). And He is the Protector Worthy of all Praise.,Wyun ga mae du le be ya ao baci nan a ga kauna ba nao. Umaela yegun'u twarya yaa. Akika Wun ga yi Ndakatao Etsu nan yandondo e jin yebo ya nan.
Surah 42:29      ,         And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the living creatures that He has scattered through them: and He has power to gather them together when He wills.,U ma dan mini 'ayau zhio jinjin yan sanmazhi be kin yin to dabba nazhi ga fi bonan Uma de iko nan Uga'ku'a yekan nan ka mina u ga bau nan.
Surah 42:30   ,      Whatever misfortune happens to you is because on the things your hands have wrought and for many (of them) He grants forgiveness.,Yandondo nama ga tswan ye mini yan masi-bazhio nan etun dede yan egwa ye tso zhi ga din'u beo U mae fa be etun dede nazhi dokun nan.
Surah 42:31       ,      Nor can ye frustrate (aught) (fleeing) through the earth; nor have ye besides Allah any one to protect or to help.,Ye maa gan'gwa kin boa ye ma de Ndakata a gwo Soko gan'a ye ma de taimako jinci a gan wun'a.
Surah 42:32   ,  And among His Signs are the ships smooth-running through the ocean (tall) as mountains.,U dan mini a 'ya uzhio eya nuwan nazhie je kpe eti eduzhio nan (wyo'a le a ye ba kpako) a yi ke patizhi nan.
Surah 42:33 ,             If it be His Will He can still the Wind: then would they become motionless on the back of the (ocean). Verily in this are Signs for everyone who patiently perseveres and is grateful.,U ga bau uga efe kan gikini eyazhi kpata ci ga'kan ta ta eti eduo. Akika mini wuncin'o aya danbo ya zandondo na gae jin hakuri ucie jin yebo ya Soko nan.
Surah 42:34   ,   Or He can cause them to perish because of the (evil) which (the men) have earned; but much doth He forgive.,Ko ma wun'a jin hallaka ebo dede nazhi a lo nan. U mae fa be nan dokun nae.
Surah 42:35     ,   But let those know who dispute about Our Signs that there is for them no way of escape.,Za nazhiy mae gbomi dan mini aya Yizhio na atso ga'kpe (foga) gan a de bandonbo nan a bici lo naa.
Surah 42:36,                Whatever ye are given (here) is (but) a convenience of this life: but that which is with Allah is better and more lasting: (it is) for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord:,Akika yan dondo nan (Soko) ga la ya ye nan eman wo u yio teten-gi yan izhe natso dan be Sokoe nan ude alhei gan u ma fedun gan ya za nanzhiy ga imani jin amaa yakpe Tsocia nan.
Surah 42:37  ,       Those who avoid the greater crimes and shameful deeds and when they are angry even then forgive;,To za nanzhi e kpe ya be zunubi wancikozhiy to etun sakpazhiy nan a ma'ga a jin fushi a'jin a fa nan.
Surah 42:38   ,       Those who hearken to their Lord and establish regular Prayer; who (conduct) their affairs by mutual Consultation; who spend out of what We bestow on them for Sustenance;,To za nazhi e ye yiyi yan Tsocianan a mae kursalla gikini nan alamariazhi ma eti sha'wara bo ejin wun'o nan a maekezhe wu dukiy'a-'zhi (fi eko wangio) mini arziki nanzhi Yi la yaa nan.
Surah 42:39,     And those who when an oppressive wrong is inflicted on them (are not cowed but) help and defend themselves.,To za nazhiy zwalunci ga tswan'a a jin'a wa taimako eti jin jin gao) nan .
Surah 42:40        ,     The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto (in degree): but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation his reward is due from Allah: for (Allah) loveth not those who do wrong.,Egagba yan etun dede ma dede iri dozhin'u. Za nan ma gabea fa nan uci jin bolobolo nan ladau dan eba Soko akika Sokoe wa azwalumizhia.
Surah 42:41  ,      But indeed if any do help and defend themselves after a wrong (done) to them against such there is no cause of blame.,Zanan ma gaa jin ga baci nan u jin zwalunci nan zawuncinzhi lefi ndondota etia boa
Surah 42:42 ,             The blame is only against those who oppress men and wrong-doing and insolently transgress beyond bounds through the land defying right and justice: for such there will be a penalty grievous.,Akika lefi ta eti za nazhie jin zawangizhi zw-alunci nao a cie gwo iyaaka gan kpe eti kinbo umajin eti gaskiya boa nan. Akika za wuncinzhi azaba nan tan wuncinzhi tabbata ya'a.
Surah 42:43 ,      But indeed if any show patience and forgive that would truly be an exercise of courageous will and resolution in the conduct of affairs.,Za nan ma ga ankuri jin u ci fa nan akika wuncin dan mini alamari nan zhiy gbota nao.
Surah 42:44       ,            For any whom Allah leaves astray there is no protector thereafter. And thou wilt see the Wrong-doers when in sight of the Penalty Say: "Is there any way (to effect) a return",Zaeni ndondo na Soko ga u gbin nan wun'ade ndakata ndoci zunma'u boa wyo ma'ale azwalumizhi ye kami nan aga le azaba ye nan acia fe gan ga'n: Ngba yi ade kafa ndoci be nan yi ga'zheban da izhe na'a
Surah 42:45     ,                     And thou wilt see them brought forward to the (Penalty) in a humble frame of mind because of (their) disgrace (and) looking with a stealthy glance. And the Believers will say: "Those are indeed in loss who have given to perdition their own selves and those belonging to them on the Day of Judgment. Behold! Truly the Wrong-doers are in a lasting Penalty!",Wyo ma'a lea ye afe'kua tu yi kpe eti enao aci gaa gba a ga'sunzunye a fe yi ba yi cinle. Za nazhiy a imani jin nan ci gan:Akika eza asarazhiy aga yi za nanzhiy ajin asara yan etitacin'azhio to yan iyaliazhi efo Alkiyami nao Akika azwalumizhi a fi mini azaba na'a kugikini nao.
Surah 42:46   ,            And no protectors have they to help them other than Allah. And for any whom Allah leaves to stray there is no way (to the Goal).,Amaa de ndakatazhi nazhi'a jin'a taimako baci Soko naa. Akika zandondo nan Soko ga u gbin nan Wun'a ke eko bea.
Surah 42:47     ,               Hearken ye to your Lord before there come a Day which there will be no putting back because of (the Ordainment of) Allah! that Day there will be for you no place of refuge nor will there be for you any room for denial (of your sins)!,Efe ye yiyi yan Tso'ci ye shidzo kafi efo nan wun'a ye dagwa yaa nan u be dagan eba Soko' na. Ye'a de eswoba ndodo fo wuncin'a a maade zandondo nan'a gbo mi naa.
Surah 42:48      ,                    If then they run away We have not sent thee as a guard over them. Thy duty is but to convey (the Message). And truly when We give man a taste of a Mercy from Ourselves he doth exult thereat but when some ill happens to him on account of the deeds which his hands have sent forth truly then is man ungrateful!,Gancin a ga zunma zheta Yi tun'wyo fia gan wyo yo feo tswa'ao za'a.

Kami nan Yi ga yegun yi la'a ya zawangi degi na wun'afe jin alfahri beu Yin kamina ma eyan dede gaa tswan'a ebo etun dede azhio nan akika kanga zawangi ga cin mannabo be Sokoe.
Surah 42:49     ,         To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills (and plans). He bestows (children) male or female according to His Will (and Plan),Mulki yan sanmazhi to kin Soko wun'o Wun'ejin yan na ga bau nan Wun'e twarya ynzagizhi ya za nan ga bau nan U mea twarya bagizhi ya za nan ga bau nan.
Surah 42:50  ,        Or He bestows both males and females and He leaves barren whom He will: for He is full of Knowledge and Power.,Ko ma wun'a zhin keba bagizhi to ynzagizhi za nan ma ga bau nan wun'u ya raama gbasan'yn (wun'a degi ndondo ma'a) akika Etsu kpikpe u yio Etsu iko.
Surah 42:51        ,             It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration or from behind a veil or by the sending of a messenger to reveal with Allah´s permission what Allah wills: for He is Most High Most Wise.,U ma gwo Yin na a gan gan Soko gan gan be alita ndondoe naa (eye be eye) saide be wahayiy ko ma zunmata yan yekan ndocio ko ma wun'a tun Tuci tun ucia jin wahayi yau be izini'u yin yan yannan ga bau na akika Etsu elatu u yio Egba u yio.
Surah 42:52         ,                 And thus have We by Our Command sent inspiration to thee: thou knewest not (before) what was Revelation and what was Faith; but We have made the (Qur´an) a Light wherewith We guide such of Our servants as We will; and verily thou dost guide (men) to the Straight Way-,Acinga ga Yijin wahayi be ya wye yan Alkuranu dagan foro yi bo zunma ba tsozhio wyo de kpikpe Litafia wyo ma kpe Imani yea amma'de Yi u laafe haske Yie la'jin zanan ga ba yi na shiri mini wuzhi yi zhio.

Surah 42:53       ,       The Way of Allah to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. Behold (how) all affairs tend towards Allah!,Eko yan Soko Etsu nan wun yan na fi sanmazhio to kin bo na akika ezhe keba yan alamari kpata eba Soko bo u dan'o. 
﻿Surah 43:1, Ha-Mim,HEU MIM.
Surah 43:2 ,By the Book that makes things clear-,Mie zhi kuti be (Alkuranuy) Litafi nan yi be bayanizhiy naa tula nan.
Surah 43:3  ,   We have made it a Qur´an in Arabic that ye may be able to understand (and learn wisdom).,Akika Yi'u la afe Alkuranu be zhimi larubawazhiy ebo ye la'efe eza ankalizhi.

Surah 43:4    ,  And verily it is in the Mother of the Book in Our Presence high (in dignity) full of wisdom.,Akika Alkuranu dan mini Nna yan Litafizhio (lauhul-Mahfuz) eba Yi bo ma Alkuranu litafi na latu nan uyio naa she be hikimae nan.
Surah 43:5     ,  Shall We then take away the Message from you and repel (you) for that ye are a people transgressing beyond bounds,Kashiy Yi ga cin cin be yan sinsantu lugwaa baenio ebo nan ye yeafe za nanzhie nyin yan kpe kin bo nan
Surah 43:6  ,   But how many were the prophets We sent amongst the peoples of old,Eka nan dokun nan Yi tun Annabi fi jamaa yan mafarizhi.
Surah 43:7 ,      And never came there a prophet to them but they mocked him.,A ma de Annabi ndondo nan be ya'a na'a sai de 'afe la'u mi.
Surah 43:8   ,   So We destroyed (them)- stronger in power than these;- and (thus) has passed on the Parable of the peoples of old.,Yimaa za nazhiy gboka gan'a nan jin hallaka iri az'aba nan tswan za mafarizhi na cia da eti atso gwo gan.
Surah 43:9     ,    If thou wert to question them ´Who created the heavens and the earth´ They would be sure to reply ´they were created by (Him) the Exalted in Power Full of Knowledge´;-,Wallahi wyo ga gbin'a gan gan: Ziy jin alitta sanmazhi to kin yin'o Akika a'yazhe gan Soko Etsu zankpe Etsu kpikpe ga jin alittaao.
Surah 43:10     ,     (Yea the same that) has made for you the earth (like a carpet) spread out and has made for you roads (and channels) therein in order that ye may find guidance (on the way);,Etsu naa kin ta cici ya ye parae nan U cia ekozhi sa fi bo ya ye nan. Ebo ye debae laede bawu nan.
Surah 43:11     ,      That sends down (from time to time) rain from the sky in due measure;- and We raise to life therewith a land that is dead; even so will ye be raised (from the dead);-,Etsu nae du ele zhin dagan sanmao be tsunwan'e nan Yicia ezhi tsutsucizhi dan rayi be'u yin. A cin ga ga a ku ye tso tinya dagan kabariezhi bo.
Surah 43:12    ,      That has created pairs in all things and has made for you ships and cattle on which ye ride,Etsu nan jin alitta eba be yiwozhiy kpata nan U ci kezhe jin eya nuwanzhi nan yeade ganfi nan to dabbazhiy nanzhiy yede tu nan.
Surah 43:13  ,                 In order that ye may sit firm and square on their backs and when so seated ye may celebrate the (kind) favour of your Lord and say "Glory to Him Who has subjected these to our (use) for we could never have accomplished this (by ourselves),Ebo ye debae lae fedun'ekpe zunmaabo yemae fe pa niimayan Tsoci yezhi kami nan ye gaa fe dun ta etiabo nan ye mae gan gan:Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya Etsu naa (e yan tuci) nan nan jin foro ya yi nan akika yi de kagbo ndondo ta eti ezan daa bo'a.
Surah 43:14  , "And to our Lord surely must we turn back!"Akika kpata yi ma eba Tsoci yi ga yia kezhe lo.
Surah 43:15     ,   Yet they attribute to some of His servants a share with Him (in his godhead)! truly is man a blasphemous ingrate avowed!,Acia za ndoci tsa ya'u mini wuzhi'u zhio (ke wun ga yi egi wun'o nan) akika zawangi eza uyio nae cin manan bo be Sokoenan manan cin'bo naa tula nan.
Surah 43:16 ,     What! has He taken daughters out of what He himself creates and granted to you sons for choice,Ngba wun'a egi ynzagizhi tsa mini alittauzhio U cia ye tsa be egi bagizhiy
Surah 43:17     ,      When news is brought to one of them of (the birth of) what he sets up as a likeness to (Allah) Most Gracious his face darkens and he is filled with inward grief!,A ma ga ya zaeni miniabo labari yangban fa be egi ynzagiy nan'e da gan gan: Soko Al-Rahmanu tsa gan.

Surah 43:18    ,    Is then one brought up among trinkets and unable to give a clear account in a dispute (to be associated with Allah),Ngba' (ye ga dangi tsa ya Soko). Be za nae sa sa dan mini ninpao nan za nan man ka wun'abe ewun sunzhi wun'a kpe gan ri woa nan
Surah 43:19      ,     And they make into females angels who themselves serve Allah. Did they witness their creation Their evidence will be recorded and they will be called to account!,Acia Malaikazhi nazhiy yi wuzhi Soko na la ynzagizhi. Beke a jin ri jinka mi nan a jin alittaa nan A kika a ga eri azhi ka a-maa gbin'a gan (efo Alkiyamiy).
Surah 43:20   ,           ("Ah!") they say "If it had been the will of (Allah) Most Gracious we should not have worshipped such (deities)!" Of that they have no knowledge! they do nothing but lie!,Aci gan: Wun'a ba Soko Al-Rahmanu ba ngan yi yaajin bauta ya (Malaikazhia). Ade kpikpe ndoci eti wuncin boa akika a de'tswa ganmana tswa kawanyin.
Surah 43:21  ,     What! have We given them a Book before this to which they are holding fast,Kashiy Yi la Litafi ndoci laa ya'a shi Alkuranu dzo Wuncin ci la a egwa sun'u gbanyin.
Surah 43:22  ,        Nay! they say: "We found our fathers following a certain religion and we do guide ourselves by their footsteps.",Ade gan: Akika yi tsun yanmanci yizhi kpe eti izhe le iri ndocio etaazhi ga ma yi ga emi tuo.
Surah 43:23     ,               Just in the same way whenever We sent a Warner before thee to any people the wealthy ones among them said: "We found our fathers following a certain religion and we will certainly follow in their footsteps.",Acinga ga u ma yio Yi laa tun gangba jin ci tun dan ezhi ndocio shi wyo dzo lea sai de bagwo deciazhi a'gan gan: Yi de tsun yanmanci yizhi tsun ta eti eko izhe le ndocio Yi ma etaazhi ga ga emi tuo.
Surah 43:24     ,        He said: "What! Even if I brought you better guidance than that which ye found your fathers following" They said: "For us we deny that ye (prophets) are sent (on a mission at all).",Gan gan: Asa bawu nan mi la be nan U gye gan natso ye tsun yanmanci yezhi kpe tiubo naa A gan: Yi de ajin kafirinci be yan nan a tun yetun nae.
Surah 43:25  ,    So We exacted retribution from them: now see what was the end of those who rejected (Truth)!,Yicia wo gbata. Cin kendoe zoba yan ganmanan zuncizhiy nan le.
Surah 43:26     ,   Behold! Abraham said to his father and his people: "I do indeed clear myself of what ye worship,:Kami na (Annabi Ibrahima gan be Babau yin to Jamaa yan'u zhi nan.jin bauta yanan.
Surah 43:27,    "(I worship) only Him Who made me and He will certainly guide me.",Sai de za nan jin alitta mi nan akika Wun ga wu mi bao.
Surah 43:28   ,   And he left it as a Word to endure among those who came after him that they may turn back (to Allah).,Uci'u fe egan wanciko naa dan'ubo fe lo mini zuriya'u zhio na ebo zawangizhi a daazhin eko (yan gaskiya).
Surah 43:29    ,    Yea I have given the good things of this life to these (men) and their fathers until the Truth has come to them and a messenger making things clear.,A'a Mi dea za nananzhiy to yanmanciazhi ya fi izheo fe wo ma har be lokaci nan gaskiya (Alkuranu) be yaa nan ganni be Tuciy naa tula nan.
Surah 43:30   ,     But when the Truth came to them they said: "This is sorcery and we do reject it.",Kamina gaskiya (Alkuranu) be yaa nan a gan: nan nan eyan ma uyio yima'a kafirinci jin beu yin.
Surah 43:31     ,    Also they say: "Why is not this Qur´an sent down to some leading man in either of the two (chief) cities",A ci gan: Kiy la aci cin Alkuranu nan nan be ya bagi ko ndoci mini Alkarya guba nazhiy wancin nan boa yin'o
Surah 43:32    ,                    Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of thy Lord It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in the life of this world: and We raise some of them above others in ranks so that some may command work from others. But the Mercy of thy Lord is better than the (wealth) which they amass.,Kashi a gae gan eryatwa yan Tsoci wyo yo Ngan Yi gae gan Arzikiazhi ya' izhe bo Yi maa daraja yan sashiazhi la'ata eti yan sashio ebo adeba la dozhi etun yegun yan Tsoci wyo ma ude alheri gan (eyan izhe) nanzhiy e ku ye kan nan.
Surah 43:33    ,            And were it not that (all) men might become of one (evil) way of life We would provide for everyone that blasphemes against (Allah) Most Gracious silver roofs for their houses and (silver) stair-ways on which to go up,Ka'Ujin ebo nan zawangizhi a bea zhe'a yan ni na boa (eba fitina eyande izheo naa) da yi ga katanti yan emi kafirizhi laafe azurfa to ekpa nanzhiy a fe da lo (kata) fiti nan.
Surah 43:34  ,  And (silver) doors to their houses and thrones (of silver) on which they could recline,Yi maa kezhea kpako yan emiazhi to gado'azhi (jin be azurfae) nan a fe de kpetso ta nan.
Surah 43:35  ,         And also adornments of gold. But all this were nothing but conveniences of the present life: The Hereafter in the sight of thy Lord is for the Righteous.,To kaya ninpazhi kpata wuncinzhi ma eyan emawo izhe ayio akika ma emi yan zoba wangi wun'ajin tabbata ya za nanzhie tswa Soko nan.
Surah 43:36    ,      If anyone withdraws himself from remembrance of (Allah) Most Gracious We appoint for him an evil one to be an intimate companion to him.,Zandondo nan gae le izhe ke pipa Soko lugwa nan Yi ga shaitan laa pa ma beu yin Uci gaazhe eya manciu.
Surah 43:37 ,     Such (evil ones) really hinder them from the Path but they think that they are being guided aright!Akika ma shaitanzhi ga'a kan eko guruzhi yinda acia fe le ye ke eko bawu bo a kpeo nan.
Surah 43:38   ,       At length when (such a one) comes to Us he says (to his evil companion): "Would that between me and thee were the distance of East and West!" Ah! evil is the companion (indeed)!,Har da lokaci nan zaguba'aba a be be eba Yi nan za wuncin cia gan gan: Kasa re da' aci gan kpikpe-ya dan tsakanimi bo be wyo yin ke tsakani eyi lazhin be eyilozun'y nan (wun'a ba mi gan) akika eya dede wyo yio.
Surah 43:38     ,     At length when (such a one) comes to Us he says (to his evil companion): "Would that between me and thee were the distance of East and West!"

Surah 43:39   ,     When ye have done wrong it will avail you nothing that Day that ye shall be partners in Punishment!,(Uzuri nan nan) wun'a jin ye anfani yinnaa ebo nan ye yea eti tacin yezhi jin zwalunci (dagan izhe boa ni). Akika azaba gabo yea fi gannio.
Surah 43:40    ,      Canst thou then make the deaf to hear or give direction to the blind or to such as (wander) in manifest error,Ngba wyo la tukpa tenci wo gan wo Kashi wyo la ye bonci leba ye wo To za nan gaafe dan mini egbin nan a tula nan (ngba wyo la'u ke eko wo)

Surah 43:43   ,    So hold thou fast to the Revelation sent down to thee; verily thou art on a Straight Way.,A gwa sun wahyi nantso Yi la ya wyo nan akika wyo ta eti eko gboro.
Surah 43:44 ,    The (Qur´an) is indeed the message for thee and for thy people; and soon shall ye (all) be brought to account.Akika ma (Alkuranu) cinwan uyio ya wye to jamaa yan wyo zhi bele yin ma a gbin'e gan (eti tswitswa yan hakkiuzhio).

Surah 47:4         ,                            Therefore when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight) smite at their necks; At length when ye have thoroughly subdued them bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been Allah´s Will He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of Allah- He will never let their deeds be lost.,Kamina nan ye ga gun be kafirizhiy (ekun dao nan) e wu'a koro'o har sai ye gade zankpe ta etia bo yecie la'aedan kangi be kagboe. Baci acin'o wun'a ba ye yea ya a fea lo koma a tso a la eti tacin'a'a sa har da lokaci nan nangban yan ekun ga cin-ta nan.

Akika za nanzhi a ga'awu fi eko Soko nan etun'azhi a ta yakpea.
Surah 47:5,  Soon will He guide them and improve their condition,Bele yin Soko ga'ajin shiri u ma ga alamariazhi tadzu.
Surah 47:6,   And admit them to the Garden which He has announced for them.,Uma gaa la'a gandan Aljannanao nan ufe ya'a labari u nan.
Surah 47:7    ,    O ye who believe! If ye will aid (the cause of) Allah He will aid you and plant your feet firmly.,Ya ye nazhi'a imani jin nan ye ga jin Soko taimako wun'tso'a jin'e taimako ga uma ga kinigi yezhigboka.
Surah 47:8,     But those who reject (Allah)- for them is destruction and (Allah) will render their deeds astray (from their mark).,Zanazhiy ma'ajin kafirinci nan hallaka ga'ajin tabbata ya'a etun'azhi ma ga' nyin ya.
Surah 47:9    ,   That is because they hate the Revelation of Allah; so He has made their deeds fruitless.,Wunci ma yi ebo na a navo nan a la'mi tu na Soko cin'be yn nan Soko cia etun'azhi nyin ya.
Surah 47:10   ,            Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them (who did evil) Allah brought utter destruction on them and similar (fates await) those who reject Allah.,Kashiy a za az kpe eti kinboa acia le kendoe zoba yan za nazhiy shiadzo na' yi yi na'a Ngan Soko 'ajin hallaka to iri wuncin ma ga'ajin tabbata ya kafirizhi.
Surah 47:11  ,        That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe but those who reject Allah have no protector.,Wuncin ma yi  ebo nan Soko ga yi Ndakata yan minizhio nao akika ma kafirizhi de ndakata'a.
Surah 47:12   ,                  Verily Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; while those who reject Allah will enjoy (this world) and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode.,Akika Soko ga za nanzhiy ga jin imani a cie lo tun wngi zhi nan la gan dan Aljannao nan nuwan zhie je fi tako shin'u zhio nan. Kafirizhi ma e wo ma izhe za amae gi yan'za kendoe dabbazhie gi yanzhi za na akika enan ga yi ezhe kebao.
Surah 47:13   ,          And how many cities with more power than thy city which has driven thee out have We destroyed (for their sins) and there was none to aid them.,Alkaryazhi danbo dokun nanzhiy gboka gan za alkarya wyozhi nan zhiy nyan'wyo tin ya nan kpata yi ajin hallaka a made zandondo jin'a taimakoa.
Surah 47:14      ,      Is then one who is on a clear (Path) from his Lord no better than one to whom the evil of his conduct seems pleasing and such as follow their own lustsNgba za nae le izhe eti hujja nan fe be nko yan tsoci ubo nan ga'zhe yeni beza nan etun dedeuzhi a sa fiu acie le izhe eti etun yangban'o nan
Surah 47:15        ,                                   (Here is) a Parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised: in it are rivers of water incorruptible; rivers of milk of which the taste never changes; rivers of wine a joy to those who drink; and rivers of honey pure and clear. In it there are for them all kinds of fruits; and Grace from their Lord. (Can those in such Bliss) be compared to such as shall dwell for ever in the Fire and be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels (to pieces),Kwatankoci yan kendoe Aljanna nan Soko ajin muminizhi alkawali na uyi nan minin bo eduzhi danbo yan nuwan nan jin vunvuci'a nan.

Surah 47:16       ,                And among them are men who listen to thee but in the end when they go out from thee they say to those who have received Knowledge "What is it he said just then" Such are men whose hearts Allah has sealed and who follow their own lusts.,Ama de dan miniabo nanzhiy ajin ashi tukpa ya wy nan kami nan a ga tin ya dagan eba wyo bo nan a fe gan be gan be za nan zhiy yi be ilimiy nan gan: Ngba ki'ufe gan mangio Za wuncinzhi ga Soko te yangban'ao acia-mitu etun yangban'azhi.
Surah 47:17 ,    But to those who receive Guidance He increases the (light of) Guidance and bestows on them their Piety and Restraint (from evil).,Za nazhiy ma ga'ajin shiri nan; Soko ' abea shiri U maa Twarya be dansun' uyio dan yang Ban'abo.
Surah 47:18          ,    Do they then only wait for the Hour- that it should come on them of a sudden But already have come some tokens thereof and when it (actually) is on them how can they benefit then by their admonition,Kashiy e' tu yetu gan alkiyami ubeu dzun u fia Akika alamauzhi da bea ni. Ke a be jin jin nao kami nan Yan nae la jin gangbanan ga bea tula ya'a nao
Surah 47:19         ,    Know therefore that there is no god but Allah and ask forgiveness for thy fault and for the men and women who believe: for Allah knows how ye move about and how ye dwell in your homes.,wyo yo kpeo wo ke de akika adeyandondo nan gwo yin a jin bauta ya naa sai de Soko na wyo mao wa gafarao ya zunubi wyizhi to Mumini ba. Gizhi to mumini ynzagizhi akika Soko de kpikpi yan ba nan zhi ye iwo nan U ma de kpikpi yan ezhe kebaezhi.
Surah 47:20     ,                     Those who believe say "Why is not a sura sent down (for us)" But when a sura of basic or categorical meaning is revealed and fighting is mentioned therein thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with a look of one in swoon at the approach of death. But more fitting for them-,Za nanzhi'a imani jin nan e gan gan: kiY la aci cin sura (Woro) bea yin'o Kami nan a ga be cin Sura yan hukunci ndoci be yaa aci tun ekun ye danminiiubo nan Wyo'a le Munafikizhi ye a fe cin wyo le ke za nan nangban yan ajali a rukpeu nan robonkpe wun'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 47:21     ,      Were it to obey and say what is just and when a matter is resolved on it were best for them if they were true to Allah.,Emi latu foro be egan wangi gan'e (u ga gye gan'o). Kaminan ala'mari gaa gbo ucia tula (Ke ekun gun ga gan'o) nan a ga Soko ya gaskiya ya (a cia tin ya) da wuncin'ade alheri ya'gan.
Surah 47:22      ,   Then is it to be expected of you if ye were put in authority that ye will do mischief in the land and break your ties of kith and kin,Akika kyengi u yio yega bea zunma zheta (yeci da gun kun'a) ye'a bea fe za nanzhie nyin yan kpe eti kinbo nan ye ci ga'afe za nan zhie sa dangi bo ya na.
Surah 47:23 ,     Such are the men whom Allah has cursed for He has made them deaf and blinded their sight.,Za wuncinzhi ga Soko bu kuti kpeo u cia te tukpa Ucia eyeazhi nan (e le gaskiya ye bea sai ganmanan).
Surah 47:24  ,    Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Qur´an or are their hearts locked up by them,Kashiy e kpa ye kpa nan shidunan eti Alkuranu boa Kashiy a giyekozhi la'atsu'a yangbanzhi tsu
Surah 47:25    ,           Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them- the Evil One has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes.,Akika za nazhi a zunma laa ya a adini nan(acia jin ridda) baci nan bayani yan bawu a tula ya'ani nan akika Sheitan ga pa (kafirinci) nin fi ao wunga ma gan gan fia eti bo.
Surah 47:25   ,            Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them- the Evil One has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes.,Akika za nazhi a zunma laa ya a adini nan(acia jin ridda) baci nan bayani yan bawu a tula ya'ani nan akika Sheitan ga pa (kafirinci) nin fi ao wunga ma gan gan fia eti bo.
Surah 47:26     ,         This because they said to those who hate what Allah has revealed "We will obey you in part of (this) matter"; but Allah knows their (inner) secrets.,Wuncin mayi ebo nan a gan be za nazhie na hukunci nan Soko cinzhiyn vo nan gan: Yi ga mi tu ye dan mini alamari ndocizhio. Akika Soko de kpikpe yannazhiy e swo nan.
Surah 47:26  ,            This because they said to those who hate what Allah has revealed "We will obey you in part of (this) matter"; but Allah knows their (inner) secrets.,Wuncin mayi ebo nan a gan be za nazhie na hukunci nan Soko cinzhiyn vo nan gan: Yi ga mi tu ye dan mini alamari ndocizhio. Akika Soko de kpikpe yannazhiy e swo nan.
Surah 47:27 ,     But how (will it be) when the angels take their souls at death and smite their faces and their backs,Gancin Ke'a da da nao kami nan Malaikazhi gae gwo rayi be'a yin acie wu'a fuskazhio to zunmazhio nao
Surah 47:28 ,        This because they followed that which called forth the Wrath of Allah and they hated Allah´s good pleasure; so He made their deeds of no effect.,Wuncin ma yi ebo nan a emi laatu yan nan Soko wa'a nan acia nanvo la'a dan yedajin'u bo nan U cia etun'zhi gbin ya.
Surah 47:29    ,      Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think that Allah will not bring to light all their rancour,Kashiy za nan zhiy yi be batan yan yangban'e'na'e kpa ye kpa gan eyan dede nazhiy a swo fi yangban'o nan Soko a kua tin ya woa
Surah 47:30     ,      Had We so wiled We could have shown them up to thee and thou shouldst have known them by their marks: but surely thou wilt know them by the tone of their speech! And Allah knows all that ye do.U ga ba Yi ba da yi ga 'la wu wye akika ma wyo gaa kpeye be alamaazhiy wyo ma'a kezhe kpea ye eba egan kogiazhio. Akika Soko de kpikpe yan etun nazhi ye lo nan.
Surah 47:31    ,   And We shall try you until We test those among you who strive their utmost and persevere in patience; and We shall try your reported (mettle).Wallahi Yi gae mancin le har sai za nazhi gae jin jihadi ebo Soko nan ga tula minie bo to za nazhie jin ankuri nan yi ma ga labariezhi mancin le.
Surah 47:32      ,              Those who reject Allah hinder (men) from the Path of Allah and resist the Messenger after Guidance has been clearly shown to them will not injure Allah in the least but He will make their deeds of no effect.,Akika za nazhie jin kafirci acie kan zawangizhi eko Soko yn da nan ama kezhea le tuci ba baci nan bayani yan bawu a tula ya aa ni na a la egun ndondotso Soko woa Soko ma ga'a etunzhi nyi ya.
Surah 47:33   ,      O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey the messenger and make not vain your deeds!,Ya ye nazhia imani jin nan! Yea mi tu Soko ye mae la mie tu tuci ye mae ga nyin etun'ezhi ya ma.
Surah 47:34    ,          Those who reject Allah and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah then die rejecting Allah- Allah will not forgive them.,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci acie kan zawangizhi eko yan Soko yn da nan gancin acia tsu eti kafirincio nan Soko fa bea yin'a.
Surah 47:35     ,      Be not weary and faint-hearted crying for peace when ye should be uppermost: for Allah is with you and will never put you in loss for your (good) deeds.,Ega to gbogun ma Ye mae ga tan'a gwa fe wa gyra bea yin ma. Akika yega ta eti abo Soko ma dan be ye yin U maa ta etun yezhi ya kpea.
Surah 47:36          ,  The life of this world is but play and amusement: and if ye believe and guard against Evil He will grant you your recompense and will not ask you (to give up) your possessions.,Akika rayuwa izhe edzo u yio be Shagalae Ye ma ga imani jin ye cie sundan Soko U ma'a gbin yegan yan dukiya yezhia.
Surah 47:37 ,    If He were to ask you for all of them and press you ye would covetously withhold and He would bring out all your ill-feeling.,Uga gbin ye gan yan dukiya yezhi ye gau le ye eba yiba nan yemaafe tan yanbo U ma ga eyan dede nazhiy ye pa fi yangban'o nan ku ke fi-li.
Surah 47:38  ,                          Behold ye are those invited to spend (of your substance) in the Way of Allah: But among you are some that are niggardly. But any who are niggardly are so at the expense of their own souls. But Allah is free of all wants and it is ye that are needy. If ye turn back (from the Path) He will substitute in your stead another people; then they would not be like you!,Ye dan nan ye ga e yi gan ye be wu dukiyayezhie fi eko Soko bo mini ebo ade nazhie tan'yanbo na akika zaeni ndondo na ga tan yanbo nan eti tacin'u gau tan be yin'o Soko Etsu kunkunke u yio yetso tsa yi talakazhio.

Surah 48:2    ,          That Allah may forgive thee thy faults of the past and those to follow; fulfil His favour to thee; and guide thee on the Straight Way;,Ebo Soko'u deba'o fa be wyo yin yan zunbi wyozhi nazhi'a shidzo nan to nazhi ke wyo'a be jin-nan U ma'u la ni'ima' uzhi'u shekpan'uta eti wyo bo Uma'u wu wyo ba yan eko nantso yi gboro nan.
Surah 48:3  , And that Allah may help thee with powerful help.,Soko ma' ajin'o taimako taimako nantso'a zankpe nan.
Surah 48:4    ,              It is He Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the Believers that they may add faith to their faith;- for to Allah belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom;-,Wun ga yi Etsu nan cin yangban tacin be dan yangban Muminizhi bo nan ebo a de ba'abe imani'a be imani'a kagbocizhi kpata yan sanmazhi to yan kin Soko wun'a o akika Soko ma'afe Etsu nan yibe kpikpe yan'dondoe nan Etsu hikima.
Surah 48:5      ,            That He may admit the men and women who believe to Gardens beneath which rivers flow to dwell therein for aye and remove their ills from them;- and that is in the sight of Allah the highest achievement (for man)-,Ebo'u la mumini bagizhi to mumini ynzagizhi u gan'u dan aljannazhio nanzhiy nuwanzhie je fi taakoabo na ama'a fibo fi tutun yin u ma ga etun dedeazhi kpata fin'ya wuncin ma'afe rabo nan wancin ana.
Surah 48:6     ,               And that He may punish the Hypocrites men and women and the Polytheists men and women who imagine an evil opinion of Allah. On them is a round of Evil: the Wrath of Allah is on them: He has cursed them and got Hell ready for them: and evil is it for a destination.,Uma'u la munafiki bagizhi to munafikiynzagizhi to bagi nazhie la yan pa Soko baci nan' to yinzagi nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na u jin azaba za nazhie kpa-ye dede be Sokoe nan hallaka gaajin tabbata ta etia bo Soko ma'a zhe-wunbeayin uma kuti bu kpea u ma'enan yan jahannama jin shiri yaa akika zobaazhi maa biye.
Surah 48:7   ,    For to Allah belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom.,Kagbocizhi kpata yan samazhi to kin Soko wun'o akika Soko ma'afe Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima.
Surah 48:8  ,  We have truly sent thee as a witness as a bringer of Glad Tidings and as a Warner:,Akika yi ya wyo tun tun wyo la'o fe za naajin ri nan to za nae ya labari yangban fa nan to za nae jin gangba nan.
Surah 48:9      , In order that ye (O men) may believe in Allah and His Messenger that ye may assist and honour Him and celebrate His praise morning and evening.,Ebo acin'o ye'a imani jin be Sokoe to be tuciu yin ye mae jin'u taimako ye mae fe li'u tsa tsa yin to lazhin to lozun.
Surah 48:10 ,                       Verily those who plight their fealty to thee do no less than plight their fealty to Allah: the Hand of Allah is over their hands: then any one who violates his oath does so to the harm of his own soul and any one who fulfils what he has covenanted with Allah- Allah will soon grant him a great Reward.,Akika za nazhie jin mubaya'a (zunmatu yan baeni) be wyo yin nan akika Soko tsa ajin mubaya'a beyin'o yin nan akika Soko ta eti egwa'azhio gancin za nan ga alkawali'u lo'ya nan eti taci'u tsa'u jin gun'o zaeni ndondo na ma ga yan nan wun'ajin Soko alkawali nan she nan Soko ayau lada nan wancin nan.

They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: "Who then has any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with Allah if His Will is to give you some loss or to give you some profit But Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do.,Bele'yin za nazhiy yi za zunmazhi na (nanzhi dzunda gunkun'ana) mini larubawa laticizhio na a gan gan: 'dukiya yizhi to iyali yizhi a yi jin shagala wyo ga jin'oba gafara ya yi.

Surah 48:13    ,    And if any believe not in Allah and His Messenger We have prepared for those who reject Allah a Blazing Fire!,Zaeni ndondo na ma ya Soko be tuci'u yin gaskiyaa nan da akika yi jin shiri yan azaba ena sa'iru ya kafirizhi.
Surah 48:14    ,         To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills: but Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Soko ga wun mulki yan sanmazhi to kin yin'o fe be za nan ga ba'u nan Umae jin za na bau na azaba.

Surah 48:15      ,                        Those who lagged behind (will say) when ye (are free to) march and take booty (in war): "Permit us to follow you." They wish to change Allah´s decree: Say: "Not thus will ye follow us: Allah has already declared (this) beforehand": then they will say "But ye are jealous of us." Nay but little do they understand (such things).,Beleyin eza zunma wuncinzhi a gan gan kamina nan ye gae lo gani ma (arziki yan ekun) zhi'yn kuzhi nan "e lugwa yi la mitu ye yiy" e wa gan'a la egan Soko a zhe gba.

Then if ye show obedience Allah will grant you a goodly reward but if ye turn back as ye did before He will punish you with a grievous Penalty.",Gan ya za nazhi yi za zunmazhi mini larubawa laticizhio nan; Bele yin a be yi ye lo eba jama'a ndocizhinanzhiy gboka sarawyin nan ebo ye dae gun'a kun ko ma a la lo musulunci ye ga mitu foro nan nan Sokoa yae laa da nayi wangi naye ma ga zunma zheta kendoe ye kayn jin shidzo batsozhi na Wun'a jin'e azaba nan tan sarauyin anan.
Surah 48:17 ,                         No blame is there on the blind nor is there blame on the lame nor on one ill (if he joins not the war): But he that obeys Allah and his Messenger- (Allah) will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and he who turns back (Allah) will punish him with a grievous Penalty.,Leifi ta eti yebonci boa (kagan ulo ekun daa na'a) to za nan de bicia nan boa.

Surah 48:18  ,                Allah´s Good Pleasure was on the Believers when they swore Fealty to thee under the Tree: He knew what was in their hearts and He sent down Tranquillity to them; and He rewarded them with a speedy Victory;Akika Soko'a yeda jin be Muminizhiy kami nan afe jin mubaya'a be wyo yin eshin yan cigban'o nan Soko ma kpe yannanzhiy fi yangban'a bo nan Uci ci yangban tacin be yaa Ucin kezhe ya'a nasara nan tsoba nan.
Surah 48:19 ,     And many gains will they acquire (besides): and Allah is Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom.,Ganni be ganimazhiy' nan dokun nan na'ade nan Soko ma'afe Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima.
Surah 48:20    ,             Allah has promised you many gains that ye shall acquire and He has given you these beforehand; and He has restrained the hands of men from you; that it may be a Sign for the Believers and that He may guide you to a Straight Path;,Soko ma kezhe jin ye alkawali ndoci yan ganima nan ye'a de nan u cia nan nan fan fi ye U maa kun ke ya ye be ekun zawangizhiy ebo ula'ufe a ya ' u ya Muminizhi U ma'u wu ye ba'u lo eko nantso yi gborona.
Surah 48:21   ,          And other gains (there are) which are not within your power but which Allah has compassed: and Allah has power over all things.,To ndoci nan ye kunke wo ta etiaboa Nan akika Soko ama kezhe. Akika Soko ma de kagbo taeti yandon
Surah 48:22   ,        If the Unbelievers should fight you they would certainly turn their backs; then would they find neither protector nor helper.,Da aci gan kafirizhi ga gun ye kun gun daa bici gancin ma aade Ndakata'a amaa de taimako jincia.
Surah 48:23    ,       (Such has been) the practice (approved) of Allah already in the past: no change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of Allah.,Nan nan ma ekpa yan Soko u yio nan -- gan ta eti zananzhiy shidzo nao. Wyo ma'a de egbazhe ndondo dan ekpa Soko boa.
Surah 48:24     ,             And it is He Who has restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makka after that He gave you the victory over them. And Allah sees well all that ye do.,Wun ga yi za nan kangwa ekun 'azhi ya ye yeo nan U ci kangwa ekun ye ya atso'o zhinin yan Makabo baci nan wun'a ye la'a ta eti boani nao. Akika Soko a fe Etsu nae cin'ye le dan etun ndondo na ye gae lo nao.
Surah 48:25      ,                                 They are the ones who denied Revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the sacrificial animals detained from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom ye did not know that ye were trampling down and on whose account a crime would have accrued to you without (your) knowledge (Allah would have allowed you to force your way but He held back your hands) that He may admit to His Mercy whom He will. If they had been apart We should certainly have punished the Unbelievers among them with a grievous Punishment.,A ga yi za nanzhi ajin kafirinci nao acia ye kan gingandan yan Masallaci Harami nan to Hadayaotso aci u kanta a lugwa utun dannan wun'a.

Surah 48:26        ,                   While the Unbelievers got up in their hearts heat and cant - the heat and cant of ignorance- Allah sent down His Tranquillity to his Messenger and to the Believers and made them stick close to the command of self-restraint; and well were they entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allah has full knowledge of all things.,Kami nan kafirizhia egya yan nanvo la'afi yangban'a zhio nan egya yan nanvo na ma yi yan jahiliyyah nan (eza'ti zhkozhi) Soko cia yangbanshi'u cin be ya Tuci'u to Muminizhi Ucia egan yan dansun Soko la'a gboka ya'a.

Surah 48:27    ,                       Truly did Allah fulfil the vision for His Messenger: ye shall enter the Sacred Mosque if Allah wills with minds secure heads shaved hair cut short and without fear. For He knew what ye knew not and He granted besides this a speedy victory.,Akika Soko'a gaskiya nan dan enana yan Tuciubo nan la'awu'u be gaskiyae ke de ye ga gandan Masallaci Haramio nan U gaa ba Soko nan be aminciy ganni be ma'ade dansun yan dondoa soko ma kpikpe yannazhi ye-de kpikpea na Ucia nasara nantsoba nan la'gba zunma wunma.
Surah 48:28          ,   It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth to proclaim it over all religion: and enough is Allah for a Witness.,Soko ga tun Tuci'u tun be bawuy ganni be adini yan gaskiya yin'o ebo u la wun'u la'u ta eti adini ndocizhio baenio.

Surah 48:29         ,                                            Muhammad is the messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer) seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade then makes it strong; it then becomes thick and it stands on its own stem (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness and a great Reward.,(Annabi) Muhammadu Tuci Soko U yio za nazhi ma a gaskiya ya beu yin nan a gboka ama zwo lo eba kafirizhi a ma yi eza yegunzhi tsakani atso be dozhiy wyo'a le'a ye e'lo ruku'u a nae lo sujada e wa arziki za dagan eba Soko be yedau yin alamazhi dan fuskaazhio ebo ekundo yan sujadazhio kendoe a yiyi ga nan dan'o nao iriazhi madan mini Ataurao amade iriazhi dan mini Injeelao aafe ke edzo na'gwalagi uzhi laa tin ya nanaci kezhe fe gbo'uka be har maa a lekpan acia jin daidai ta'eti gbereabo Ucie ya enu nucizhi sha'wa ebo ma kafirizhi a Zhewun'agan pa'yin.

Surah 49:9    ,                         If two parties among the Believers fall into a quarrel make ye peace between them: but if one of them transgresses beyond bounds against the other then fight ye (all) against the one that transgresses until it complies with the command of Allah; but if it complies then make peace between them with justice and be fair: for Allah loves those who are fair (and just).,Ama ga be de jama'a yan Muminizhi nanzhia gan guba acie sunwun be dozhiy nan e jin gyara tsakaniabo be dozhiy gan cin nini miniabo gaa gwo iyaka gan ta eti ninio ye'a gunye-kan ye gun nantsoe gwo iyaka gan nan har she u ga yeda jin be hukuncin yan Sokoe u ga bea yeda jin e jin gyara tsakaniabo be adalinci ye tso mae jin adalinci akika Sokoe wa za nazhi gae jin adalinci.

Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah nor of the sacred month nor of the animals brought for sacrifice nor the garlands that mark out such animals nor the people resorting to the sacred house seeking of the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord. But when ye are clear of the sacred precincts and of pilgrim garb ye may hunt and let not the hatred of some people in (once) shutting you out of the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help ye one another in righteousness and piety but help ye not one another in sin and rancour: fear Allah: for Allah is strict in punishment,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you completed My favour upon you and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. But if any is forced by hunger with no inclination to transgression Allah is indeed Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,A eyan tsutsuci la'ajin haramu ya ye to egya to nakan kpu'utsun to eyan zunzunci na'atun sunna yandoci ye ta eti'ubo na'jin yan Soko'a na to dabba na'atswanni ci wu'una to na'awu be kagboe na to na pinzhin kin dagan fitio cia tsu na to na'atun yan cia tsuna to na yankungizhi sa gi na sai de na yetso ga zun na.

Surah 5:4  ,                            They ask thee what is lawful to them (as food). Say: lawful unto you are (all) things good and pure: and what ye have taught your trained hunting animals (to catch) in the manner directed to you by Allah: eat what they catch for you but pronounce the name of Allah over it: and fear Allah; for Allah is swift in taking account,E' gbin wyo gan gan kizhi alajin halali ya a yao Gan gan: "A" yannazhi yi lilici na la'ajin halali yaye.

(Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers but chaste women among the People of the Book revealed before your time- when ye give them their due dowers and desire chastity not lewdness nor secret intrigues if any one rejects faith fruitless is his work and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good),Yinna a yangici lilicizhi la'azhe halali yaye to yangici yan za nazhi ala litafi ya na halali uyio yaye yangici yetso ma halali uyi ya'ao.

If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill or on a journey or one of you cometh from offices of nature or ye have been in contact with women and ye find no water then take for yourselves clean sand or earth and rub therewith your faces and hands Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty but to make you clean and to complete his favour to you that ye may be grateful,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:12  ,                                          Allah did aforetime take a covenant from the Children of Israel and we appointed twelve captains among them. And Allah said: "I am with you: if ye (but) establish regular prayers practise regular charity believe in my messengers honour and assist them and loan to Allah a beautiful loan verily I will wipe out from you your evils and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing beneath; but if any of you after this resisteth faith he hath truly wandered from the path or rectitude.",Akika Soko ma la alkawali be Banu Isra'ila zhiy Yi ci li nunsa guwo be gubae dagan miniabo Soko ci gan: Akika mi midan ganni be ye yin yega swalla kugikini nayecia zakka dukiya yezhi wa na yecia imani jin be Tuci mizhiy ye ci jin'a taimako yeci man Soko eyan wangi akika miga etun dede yezhi finya yaye akika Mi ma ga ye la'agandan Aljannazhio nazhi nuwan eduzhie je' fi takoabo na gancin zana gabeajin kafirinci miniebo baci wuncio na akika za wuncin'a gbin ke eko gboro lugwa.
Surah 5:13 ,                              But because of their breach of their covenant We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard; they change the words from their (right) places and forget a good part of the message that was sent them nor wilt thou cease to find them- barring a few - ever bent on (new) deceits: but forgive them and overlook (their misdeeds): for Allah loveth those who are kind,To ebo alkawaliazhi nazhi a lo ya na Yi yia emi bo kpea yicia yangban'azhi la'azhe wiwoci kpakparae acie zhe egan zhi'gba ke danna'azhi lugwa acia eyankozhi nazhia san'atu na batan wyo ma'ala ke yaboa wyo afe taye le hainci (eta) ye dagan eba'abo saide zadegi miniabo (tsa wa kao).

Surah 5:14,                        From those too who call themselves Christians We did take a covenant but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them: so we estranged them with enmity and hatred between the one and the other to the day of judgment.

Say: "Why then doth He punish you for your sins Nay ye are but men- of the men he hath created: He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and He punisheth whom He pleaseth: and to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between: and unto Him is the final goal (of all)",Yahuduzhi to Nasarazhi gan: "Yi ga yi egi Soko zhi to masoyiuzhio".

Surah 5:19 ,                          O People of the Book! Now hath come unto you making (things) clear unto you Our Messenger after the break in (the series of) our messengers lest ye should say: "There came unto us no bringer of glad tidings and no warner (from evil)": But now hath come unto you a bringer of glad tidings and a warner (from evil). And Allah hath power over all things,Ya ye zaba litafizhi!

Surah 5:20   ,                  Remember Moses said to his people: "O my people! Call in remembrance the favour of Allah unto you when He produced prophets among you made you kings and gave you what He had not given to any other among the peoples,To kamina Musa gangan be jama'a yan'uzhi na: Ya ye jama'a yan mizhi efe pa ni'ima Soko na ta eti yebo na Ula Annabizhi tinya mini yebo uma ye la'agi etsuzhi uma ya ye yanna ula ya zandondo mini alitazhi boa na.
Surah 5:21 ,            "O my people! Enter the holy land which Allah hath assigned unto you and turn not back ignominiously for then will ye be overthrown to your own ruin.",Ya ye jama'a yan mizhi! Egandan kin nayi danna lilici na na Soko a ka shidzo yayena ye mae ga ya zuma ma ebo ye bea zhegba yeazhe eza asarazhi ma.
Surah 5:22 ,               They said: "O Moses! In this land are a people of exceeding strength: Never shall we enter it until they leave it: if (once) they leave then shall we enter.",A gan: Ya wyoe Musa! Akika jama'a kagboci ndocizhi fi miniubo akikama yi yia gandan nin yan'ubo woa sai aga tinya dagan miniubo to aga tinya dagan miniubo gancin akika yiga gandan.
Surah 5:23 ,                   (But) among (their) Allah-fearing men were two on whom Allah had bestowed His grace: They said: "Assault them at the (proper) Gate: when once ye are in victory will be yours; But on Allah put your trust if ye have faith.",Eza bagi guba mini za nazhie sundan Soko na nazhi Soko twa'arya be ni'imae na a gan: E gan fia dagan eko misun'o ebona ye ga'gandan akika yega'ade zankpe ta etiabo.

Surah 5:24 ,              They said: "O Moses! while they remain there never shall we be able to enter to the end of time. Go thou and thy Lord and fight ye two while we sit here (and watch).",A ci gan: Ya wyoe Musa!

Surah 5:25 ,           He said: "O my Lord! I have power only over myself and my brother: so separate us from this rebellious people!",Ugan: Ya wyoe Tsoci mi! Akika mijin mulki zandondo woa sai eti tacin mitsobe yegi mi' yin eboacin'o a gingan la'dan tsakani yibobe jama'a nazhi yi fasikizhi na.
Surah 5:25 ,           He said: "O my Lord! I have power only over myself and my brother: so separate us from this rebellious people!",Ugan: Ya wyoe Tsoci mi! Akika mijin mulki zandondo woa sai eti tacin mitsobe yegi mi' yin eboacin'o a gingan la'dan tsakani yibobe jama'a nazhi yi fasikizhi na.
Surah 5:26 ,            Allah said: "Therefore will the land be out of their reach for forty years: In distraction will they wander through the land: But sorrow thou not over these rebellious people.,(Soko) ci gan: Akika kin wunci wun'azhe haramu ya;a har yan eya shiba a fe za-zakpe ti kinbo eti kpere. Ebo acin'oga nyin yangban ya jamaa; yan fasikizhima.
Surah 5:27  ,                     Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one but not from the other. Said the latter: "Be sure I will slay thee." "Surely" said the former "Allah doth accept of the sacrifice of those who are righteous,Wyo mao gba labari yan egi guba yan Adamuo ya'a be gaskiyae lokaci na a zun dabba za guba'ba acia yan zaeni gwo ama gwo yan zaba cia. Ugan: Akika mi gaowu "Uci gan" Akika de Soko ajin'ugwo etun gwo dagan eba zanazhi gae sundan Soko na.
Surah 5:28 ,              "If thou dost stretch thy hand against me to slay me it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee: for I do fear Allah the cherisher of the worlds,Akika ka wyo ga ta egwa wye be eba mi ebo wyo la mi yan'o wu mi fe zana'a tagwa be eba wyoe ebo min'la wyo yin wu na'a. Akika mie sundan Soko Etsu nae kpa alittazhi kpata na.
Surah 5:29 ,           "For me I intend to let thee draw on thyself my sin as well as thine for thou wilt be among the companions of the fire and that is the reward of those who do wrong.",Akika mie kpa gan wyo lao zheban be lefimiyin keba be yan wyo yin ebo wyo laofeodan mini egi 'mi'nazhio. Wuncin gama yi egagba yan azwalumizhio.
Surah 5:30 ,       The (selfish) soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother: he murdered him and became (himself) one of the lost ones.Ucia sa fiu yan gban'o na uga yegi'uwu na uma ciu'wu ga gan cin ucia tinba wyun'afe dan mini eza hasarazhio.
Surah 5:31,                        Then Allah sent a raven who scratched the ground to show him how to hide the shame of his brother. "Woe is me!" said he; "Was I not even able to be as this raven and to hide the shame of my brother" then he became full of regrets,Soko cia kwankwa ndoci tun tun uci fe da gba kin ebo ulau'wu'u kendoe uga swo ekun yegiu swona. Uci gan "Kasa mi re! Ngba mi ga'a gbakpan na mia jin dozhin kendoe kwankwa nana jin nana miga ekun yan yegi mi swona Ucia tinba wyun'afe dan mini za nazhieti robonkpe na.
Surah 5:32,                                       On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs yet even after that many of them continued to commit excesses in the land,Ebo dalili wuncin'o Yiciu la jin wajibi ta eti Bani Israilazhio kede akika zandondo na ga rayi wu na Uma yi be hakki yan rayi ndocia na koma eyan nyin kpe eti kinboa na to le fi za wuncin uyi ke yan za na'a zawangizhi kpata ku wu na za na maga rayi nini dan rayi na la'adau yi ke za na;a zawangizhi kpata dan rayi na Akika ma Tuci Yizhi be ya;a be bayanizhi gancin akika kundondo miniabo baci wuncin'o afe za nazhi nyin yan kpe eti kinbo na.
Surah 5:33,                                 The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution or crucifixion or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter,Akika egagba yan za nazhie gun kun be Sokoe to be Tunci Uyin na acie lotun fikinbo eti eyan nyin'o na (gara da) uga yi ala'a wu ko ma ala'afosa koma ala egwa'zhi to biciazhi'a ko'aya eti cice leba dozhio koma ala'a nyan dagan kinbo.Wuncin zun yesun uyi ya'ao dan mini izheo azaba na ma wancin na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a dan emi zobao.
Surah 5:34,            Except for those who repent before they fall into your power: in that case know that Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Sai de za nazhi ga tuba jin tun kafi ye' de zankpe' ta eti abona. Ye mae kpe' wo ke Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegu ma uyio na.
Surah 5:35 ,           O ye who believe! Do your duty to Allah seek the means of approach unto Him and strive with might and main in his cause: that ye may prosper,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Esundan Soko 'ye mae wa ekpa na yega'de tsonba lobau na yemaefe'jin jihadi (kokari) ta eti eko Soko (ujin wo) be wuncin'y ye ga'de robo (yan izhe to Alkiyami).
Surah 5:36 ,                      As to those who reject Faith- if they had everything on earth and twice repeated to give as ransom for the penalty of the Day of Judgment it would never be accepted of them theirs would be a grievous penalty,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci na da'aci gan yannazhi fi kinbo kpata na aga wun'o to ndoci dozhin'ube ebo ala'asa etia dagan azaba Efo Alkiyamiy a gwo egwa'aboa azaba nama tan saranyinna ga'jin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 5:37,           Their wish will be to get out of the Fire but never will they get out therefrom: their penalty will be one that endures.,E'wa gan' ala'adzun'a tin'aya dagan mini enao ama jin za nazhia dzun tinya bo na'a azaba na tsoa fedun na wun'a jin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 5:38,            As to the thief Male or female cut off his or her hands: a punishment by way of example from Allah for their crime: and Allah is Exalted in power,To igbeci bagi to igbeci yinzagi yea egwa'azhi gubaba ko ya egagba uyio yan woce na 'ace nao azaba yan ewunna uyio dagan eba Soko. Soko ma Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 5:39 ,            But if the thief repents after his crime and amends his conduct Allah turneth to him in forgiveness; for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Zandondo na ga tuba jin na baci yan zwalunci na ujin na uci kezhea haliu tadzu na akika Soko Etsu ga'fara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 5:40  ,                Knowest thou not that to Allah (alone) belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth He punisheth whom He pleaseth and He forgiveth whom He pleaseth: and Allah hath power over all things,Kashi wyo kpe kpe gan akika Soko ga wun mulki samazhi to kin yin'o wyun'ejin za na ga ba una azaba Soko ma de kagbo ta eti yandondo'.
Surah 5:41  ,                                                                O Messenger! let not those grieve thee who race each other into unbelief: (whether it be) among those who say "We believe" with their lips but whose hearts have no faith; or it be among the Jews- men who will listen to any lie- will listen even to others who have never so much as come to thee. They change the words from their (right) times and places: they say "If ye are given this take it but if not beware!" If any one´s trial is intended by Allah thou hast no authority in the least for him against Allah. For such - it is not Allah´s will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment,Ya wyoe Tuci! Ga lugwa bojin za nazhie san-ngan na fi mini kafircio na nyin wyoe yangban ma dagan mini za nazhie gan tinya misun'azhio gan: Yi yia imani jin na imani matun yangban' a na.

Surah 5:42 ,                        (They are fond of) listening to falsehood of devouring anything forbidden. If they do come to thee either judge between them or decline to interfere. If thou decline they cannot hurt thee in the least. If thou judge judge in equity between them. For Allah loveth those who judge in equity,Ezazhi ayio nazhie dokun be tukpshiy ya ganmana na amae dokun be gi gi haramuy ebo acin'o aga be eba wyoe jin hukunci tsakaniabo ko ma wyo dzun gan'abo.

Surah 5:43,              But why do they come to thee for decision when they have (their own) law before them- therein is the (plain) command of Allah; yet even after that they would turn away. For they are not (really) People of Faith,Ki ma la acie be ba wyoe eti hukunci bo ala'li ma litafi' Attaura danbeayin miniubo ma hukunci Soko danbo ganci acie la zunma zheta ba'aci yan bayani wuncin 'bo Za wuncinzhi nazhie jin aninga na ajin muminizhia.
Surah 5:44,                                        It was We who revealed the law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews by the prophets who bowed (as in Islam) to Allah´s will by the rabbis and the doctors of law: for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah´s book and they were witnesses thereto: therefore fear not men but fear me and sell not my signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed they are (no better than) Unbelievers,Akika yicin litafi Attaura miniubo mabawu danbo to haske Annabizhi nazhia kpatsun ta ya foro Soko baenio na e laujinhukunci ya yahuduzhi to man nazhie wuzazhi ba lo eba Soko na to man kpikpezhi be iri yanna awa bea yin yan tswitswa litafi Soko na atsoma;afe eri yacizhi eti wuncin'o.

Surah 5:45,                              We ordained therein for them: "Life for life eye for eye nose or nose ear for ear tooth for tooth and wounds equal for equal." But if any one remits the retaliation by way of charity it is an act of atonement for himself. And if any fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed they are (No better than) wrong-doers,Yi ma hukunci jin tiile ta eti abo dan miniubo kede ala rayia wu na wyuntso ga rayi wuna ala eya za'awa wyuntso ga wa za eye na to eye be eye to tukpa be tukpae to yikan be yikan'e to eba eba yinzhio egagba yan jinjinga ga wunayio.

Surah 5:46  ,                       And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary confirming the Law that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah,Yicia dida la'adan eti eta'azhio be Isah egi Maryamuy wyun'e ya gaskiya be yanna be shiudzo dagan mini Attaurao na yi ma litafi Injeela la'a yau miniubo bawu danbo to haske wyuntso mae ya gaskiya be yan na beshidzo dagan mini Attaurao na Uma yi bawu be wa'aziy ya za nazhi gae sundan Soko na.
Surah 5:47,               Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed they are (no better than) those who rebel,To jama'a yan litafi Injeeluzhi ajin hukunci be yanna Soko cin be fi bo na. Zandondo na maejin hukunci be yanna Soko cin be yin'a na to za wuncinzhi agayi fasikizhio.
Surah 5:48  ,                                                To thee We sent the Scripture in truth confirming the scripture that came before it and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed and follow not their vain desires diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If Allah had so willed He would have made you a single people but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute,Yi ma litafi cin bea ya wyoe be gaskiyae na mae ya gaskiya be yanna zhi be shiudzo dagan mini litafio na na ma kezhe afe etswa ta eti abo na.

Surah 5:50,         Do they then seek after a judgment of (the days of) ignorance But who for a people whose faith is assured can give better judgment than Allah,Kashi hukunci yan jahilizhi (nazhi kpe Soko yea na) wyun ga e'wa zao Zi'I ma danbo na'ajin bolo gan eba hukunci jin'o na'agan Soko nao ya za nazhi imaniazhi agboka nao.
Surah 5:51 ,                    O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors: They are but friends and protectors to each other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them. Verily Allah guideth not a people unjust,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la yahuduzhi to Nasarazhi eya mancizhi ma.

Surah 5:52  ,                         Those in whose hearts is a disease - thou seest how eagerly they run about amongst them saying: "We do fear lest a change of fortune bring us disaster." Ah! perhaps Allah will give (thee) victory or a decision according to His will. Then will they repent of the thoughts which they secretly harboured in their hearts.,Wyo a le za nazhi batan fi yangban'azhio na ye e'dinye da lo dan miniabo acie gan gan: Yi e'sundan ebo masiba ndoci be tswan yi ma.

Surah 5:53  ,            And those who believe will say: "Are these the men who swore their strongest oaths by Allah that they were with you" All that they do will be in vain and they will fall into (nothing but) ruin,Za nazhi ma'aimani jin na cie gan gan: Ngba zanazhi ga zhikuti be Sokoe har da iyaka kutizhiazhi kede akika be ye yin adan'o nao Etun'azhi a gbin ya acia fe eza hasarazhi.
Surah 5:54 ,                                   O ye who believe! if any from among you turn back from his Faith soon will Allah produce a people whom He will love as they will love Him- lowly with the believers mighty against the rejecters fighting in the way of Allah and never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault. That is the grace of Allah which He will bestow on whom He pleaseth. And Allah encompasseth all and He knoweth all things,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:55,            Your (real) friends are (no less than) Allah His Messenger and the (fellowship of) believers- those who establish regular prayers and regular charity and they bow down humbly (in worship),Akika Ndakatako ye nayi eyamanciko ye na Ugayi Soko to Tuciu to zanazhia imani jin nao za nazhie ku swallah gikini na amae wa zakka na amae dokun be lulo yan ruku'-na.
Surah 5:56 ,         As to those who turn (for friendship) to Allah His Messenger and the (fellowship of) believers- it is the fellowship of Allah that must certainly triumph,Zandondo na ga Soko la Ndakatako nayi eyamanciko na to Tuciu to zanazhia imani jin na to akika jama'a yan Soko zhi aga wun zankpeo.
Surah 5:57,                      O ye who believe! take not for friends and protectors those who take your religion for a mockery or sport- whether among those who received the Scripture before you or among those who reject Faith; but fear ye Allah if ye have faith (indeed),Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:58 ,          When ye proclaim your call to prayer they take it (but) as mockery and sport; that is because they are a people without understanding,Kamina Ye gae yi zazhi lo jin jin swalla na u la eyan emila be edzoe. Wuncin ma yi ebo na afe zanazhi de ankalia na.
Surah 5:59  ,                 Say: "O people of the Book! Do ye disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah and the revelation that hath come to us and that which came before (us) and (perhaps) that most of you are rebellious and disobedient",Gan gan: ya ye za ba litafizhi!

Surah 5:60   ,                       Say: "Shall I point out to you something much worse than this (as judged) by the treatment it received from Allah those who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine those who worshipped evil;- these are (many times) worse in rank and far more astray from the even path!",Gan gan: Ngba min ya ye labari yan yandoci na tso biye gan wuncin ega gbao eba Soko na Uga yi za na Soko u bo'mi ucia zhe wun beu yin nao ucia ndocizhi miniabo la'azhe ebegizhi tokpu'utsun zhi to nazhi wun tagutu (eyandedezhi) na.

Surah 5:61  ,             When they come to thee they say: "We believe": but in fact they enter with a mind against Faith and they go out with the same but Allah knoweth fully all that they hide,Agan-gan-dan be kafirinciy atso ma de kpi kpi gan eti yan nazhi afe-swo na.
Surah 5:62   ,         Many of them dost thou see racing each other in sin and rancour and their eating of things forbidden. Evil indeed are the things that they do,Wyo ma'ale kun-dondo miniabo ye afe san nin dan mini etun le'fio be gbin gbintu iyaka Sokoe to gigi azhi yan yangici haramuzhio. Akika bibi be gwosun'y ajin tabbata ya etun nazhie lo na.
Surah 5:63,            Why do not the rabbis and the doctors of Law forbid them from their (habit of) uttering sinful words and eating things forbidden Evil indeed are their works,Ki'l la man yan Soko ye kpezhi to man wancikozhi ci kan'a egan le fizhi to gi gi yan haramua yin'o Akika bibi be gwosun'y wun'a jin tabbata ya etun nazhi a fe lo na.
Surah 5:64    ,                                          The Jews say: "Allah´s hand is tied up." Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the (blasphemy) they utter. Nay both His hands are widely outstretched: He giveth and spendeth (of His bounty) as He pleaseth. But the revelation that cometh to thee from Allah increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. Amongst them we have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war Allah doth extinguish it; but they (ever) strive to do mischief on earth. And Allah loveth not those who do mischief,Yahuduzhi ma gan: Egwa Soko a wan gwo.

Surah 5:65 ,          If only the People of the Book had believed and been righteous We should indeed have blotted out their iniquities and admitted them to gardens of bliss,Da' aci gan akika zaba litafizhi a imani jinjin aci sundan Soko da yi ga etun dedeazhi pa ya ya da yi ma ga'a lagandan Aljannazhio nazhi yi emi ni' ima na.
Surah 5:66 ,                      If only they had stood fast by the Law the Gospel and all the revelation that was sent to them from their Lord they would have enjoyed happiness from every side. There is from among them a party on the right course: but many of them follow a course that is evil,Da' aci gan a litafi Attaura to Injeela ku ku gikini to litafi ndoci na'acin be ya'a dagan eba Tsoci abo na da'a Soko maa fe ya'a yangici dagan fititiabo to dagan tako bicita'abo.

Surah 5:67   ,                    O Messenger! proclaim the (message) which hath been sent to thee from thy Lord. If thou didst not thou wouldst not have fulfilled and proclaimed His mission. And Allah will defend thee from men (who mean mischief). For Allah guideth not those who reject Faith,Ya wyoe Tuci!

Surah 5:68 ,                            Say: "O People of the Book! ye have no ground to stand upon unless ye stand fast by the Law the Gospel and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord." It is the revelation that cometh to thee from thy Lord that increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. But sorrow thou not over (these) people without Faith,Gan gan: "Ya ye zaba litafizhi!

Surah 5:69,                   Those who believe (in the Qur´an) those who follow the Jewish (scriptures) and the Sabians and the Christians- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day and work righteousness- on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve,Akika za nazhi imani jin nato za nazhi ga tuba jin mini yahuduzhio na to swabiuzhi(za nazhia pan ke eko lugwa na) to Nasarazhi ndondo na ga imani jin be Sokoe na to be Efo Alkiyami na uci kezhe lo tun wangi na to dansun danbo ya'a to yangban yin ndondo ma danbo ya'a.
Surah 5:70,                  We took the covenant of the Children of Israel and sent them messengers every time there came to them a messenger with what they themselves desired not - some (of these) they called impostors and some they (go so far as to) slay,Akika yi la alkawali br Bani Israilazhiyi ma tun Tucizhi fia kandondo na Tuci ga be ya'a be yan nazhi ba yangban'azhia na sashizhi u yi ganmana sashi ndoci ma a fe wu Tucizhi.
Surah 5:71 ,                 They thought there would be no trial (or punishment); so they became blind and deaf; yet Allah (in mercy) turned to them; yet again many of them became blind and deaf. But Allah sees well all that they do,Aci fe kpaye gan fitina ndondoa na'a gancin acia na ye a ma'a te tukpa gancin Soko ci fa bea yin gancin ekundondoazhi ci kezhea na 'ye acia te tukpa Soko mae cin'a le be iri etu nazhi e'lo na.
Surah 5:72   ,                             They do blaspheme who say: "Allah is Christ the son of Mary." But said Christ: "O Children of Israel! worship Allah my Lord and your Lord." Whoever joins other gods with Allah- Allah will forbid him the garden and the Fire will be his abode. There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help,Akika za nazhiga gan gan: "Akika Masihu egi Maryama gayi Soko na a jin kafirinci Masihu ma gan: "Ya ye Bani Israilazhie jin bauta ya Soko na yi Tsoci mi to Tsoci ye na.

Surah 5:72,                                They do blaspheme who say: "Allah is Christ the son of Mary." But said Christ: "O Children of Israel! worship Allah my Lord and your Lord." Whoever joins other gods with Allah- Allah will forbid him the garden and the Fire will be his abode. There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help.Akika za nazhiga gan gan: ",Akika Masihu egi Maryama gayi Soko na a jin kafirinci Masihu ma gan: "Ya ye Bani Israilazhie jin bauta ya Soko na yi Tsoci mi to Tsoci ye na.

Surah 5:73    ,                    They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity: for there is no god except One Allah. If they desist not from their word (of blasphemy) verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them,Akika za nazhi gan gan: Akika Soko za taci yan guta u yio' na a jin kafirinci ama de Tsoci ndocia sai de Tsoci nini ke'tekagan ma akegan be yannaegan na yan'a akika azaba na tan na ga'a two za nazhia jin kafirinci miniabo.
Surah 5:74 ,      Why turn they not to Allah and seek His forgiveness For Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Kashi a ga tuba jin lo eba Sokoa ama'a ba gafara be U yin'a; alali ma Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uma yio.
Surah 5:74,       Why turn they not to Allah and seek His forgiveness For Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.Kashi a ga tuba jin lo eba Sokoa ama'a ba gafara be U yin'a; alali ma Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uma yio.
Surah 5:75,                        Christ the son of Mary was no more than a messenger; many were the messengers that passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They had both to eat their (daily) food. See how Allah doth make His signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth!,Masihu egi Maryama ufea sai de Tuci kawanyi Akika Tucizhima a be shiu dzoani nnau ma eza gaskiya uyio. Ama'a fe za nazhie gi yan gici na.Ngba cinle kendoe yie jin bayani ayazhi ya'a na gancin wyo mao cin'o le kendoe e'kua ke eko gaskiya lugwa na.
Surah 5:76     ,          Say: "Will ye worship besides Allah something which hath no power either to harm or benefit you But Allah- He it is that heareth and knoweth all things.",Gan gan: Kashi ye ajin bauta yandoci yan Soko na de mulki ndoci ta eti eyan gun'o ko eyan anfani yaye yea na Soko ma Uga yi Etsu nae wo yandondo nao Etsu na yi be kpikpe yandondoe nao.
Surah 5:77   ,                   Say: "O people of the Book! exceed not in your religion the bounds (of what is proper) trespassing beyond the truth nor follow the vain desires of people who went wrong in times gone by- who misled many and strayed (themselves) from the even way.,Gan gan: Ya ye zaba litafizhi!

Surah 5:78  ,              Curses were pronounced on those among the Children of Israel who rejected Faith by the tongue of David and of Jesus the son of Mary: because they disobeyed and persisted in excesses,A emibo kpe za nazhia jin kafirinci mini bani Israilazhio na be gintara Dawuda to Isa egi Maryamae. Wuncin ma ma yi ebo le'fia boamaafe za na zhie gbin iyaka tu na.
Surah 5:79  ,       Nor did they (usually) forbid one another the iniquities which they committed: evil indeed were the deeds which they did,Afe e kan etun dede nazhie lo na'a. Akika etun nazhi afe lo na wun'a bi ye.
Surah 5:79 ,        Nor did they (usually) forbid one another the iniquities which they committed: evil indeed were the deeds which they did,Afe e kan etun dede nazhie lo na'a. Akika etun nazhi afe lo na wun'a bi ye.
Surah 5:80,                  Thou seest many of them turning in friendship to the Unbelievers. Evil indeed are (the works) which their souls have sent forward before them (with the result) that Allah´s wrath is on them and in torment will they abide,Wyoa le ekundondo miniabo ye akafirizhi la masoyizhi. Akika yanna ala shidzo ya eti ta'cin'a na wun'a bi ye ebo na Sokoa zhe wun bea yin ama'afi mini azabao tutun yin.
Surah 5:81 ,             If only they had believed in Allah in the Prophet and in what hath been revealed to him never would they have taken them for friends and protectors but most of them are rebellious wrong-doers,Da aci gan afe za nazhia imani jin be Sokoe to be Annabiy to yan na acin be yau na da a'la kafirizhi masoyizhia. Amma'ade ekundondo miniabo fasikizhi ayio.
Surah 5:82,                         Strongest among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the Jews and Pagans; and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say "We are Christians": because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world and they are not arrogant,Akika wyoa tsun za nazhi gboka gan eba nanvo yaza nazhia imani jin na a ga yi Yahuduzhio to za nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na.

Surah 5:83,                    And when they listen to the revelation received by the Messenger thou wilt see their eyes overflowing with tears for they recognise the truth: they pray: "Our Lord! we believe; write us down among the witnesses,Kamina aga wo yanna'acin be ya Tuci na wyo a le eyeazhi ye wun'e je egiye ebo kpikpe nazhi ade yan gaskiya na acie gan gan: "Tuci yi! yi yia gaskiya ya ebo acin'o a yi kadan mini eri jincizhio.
Surah 5:84 ,              "What cause can we have not to believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us seeing that we long for our Lord to admit us to the company of the righteous",Ki'ma dan be yi yin'o har na yi yia jin imani be Soko yin'a na yin'o to yanna be yayi yan gaskiyae naa yin'o Yi mae bavun gan Tsoci yi u la yi'u gan'udan (Aljannao) gan ni be za guruzhiy.
Surah 5:85,             And for this their prayer hath Allah rewarded them with gardens with rivers flowing underneath- their eternal home. Such is the recompense of those who do good,Ebo acin'o Soko ci ga'a gba ebo egan na'aagan na be Aljannazhi nazhi nuwanzhie je fi takoabo na ama'fi bo fi tutun yin. Wuncin ga mayi egagba yan za nazhie jin bolobolo nao.
Surah 5:86,      But those who reject Faith and belie our Signs- they shall be companions of Hell-fire,Zanazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na acia aya Yi zhi yi ganmana na za wuncinzhi ga yi eyamancizhi yan ena jahimao.
Surah 5:87,                O ye who believe! make not unlawful the good things which Allah hath made lawful for you but commit no excess: for Allah loveth not those given to excess,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la eyan managizhi na Soko la'jin halali ya ye na haramu ma ye mae ga gwo iyaka ganma. Akika Sokoe wa za nazhie gwo iyaka gan na'a.
Surah 5:88,           Eat of the things which Allah hath provided for you lawful and good; but fear Allah in Whom ye believe,Ye mae gi dagan arziki na Soko la'ayaye na natso gayi halali uma yi lilici na ye mae sundan Soko na ye gan ye jin imani be yin na.
Surah 5:89,                                            Allah will not call you to account for what is futile in your oaths but He will call you to account for your deliberate oaths: for expiation feed ten indigent persons on a scale of the average for the food of your families; or clothe them; or give a slave his freedom. If that is beyond your means fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths ye have sworn. But keep to your oaths. Thus doth Allah make clear to you His signs that ye may be grateful,Sokoa wan ye yea be kuti nazhi ye dazhi yan' ti kpere na'a amma'ade wyun'a wan ye be yanazhi ye ga ta kpankoro yeci zhi kuti na Ebo acin'o kafara (kutizhi ganmana) uyi yangici la ya ezagwagbagizhi guwo dagan mini yangici tatacin na ye'gi be iyali yezhi na ko ma ye' la tufuwazhie ya'ae' fan koma ye' la wuzhie sa ula'u zhe egi.

Surah 5:90 ,             O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling (dedication of) stones and (divination by) arrows are an abomination- of Satan´s handwork: eschew such (abomination) that ye may prosper,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Akika de' egye to caca to eyan wozhi to cice yan ekwazhi (ebo wiwa yan sa'a bo) shikan uyio dagan mini etun shetan bo 'ebo acin'o yea kpeya beu yin ujinwo be wuncin'y yega tso guri yezhi.
Surah 5:91  ,                 Satan´s plan is (but) to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer: will ye not then abstain,Akika shetan de kpa gan wyun'ula ewunsun bedozhi to nanvo dozhi ula'u la'udan tsakani yebo be dozhi dan mini egyeo be cacae umau la ye yeu kan' uke pipa Soko to swalla jin'u lugwa. To ye lugwa gancin'a.
Surah 5:92 ,           Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware (of evil): if ye do turn back know ye that it is Our Messenger´s duty to proclaim (the message) in the clearest manner,Ye mae la mietu Soko ye mae la mietu Tuci (Soko) ye mae tswa minie. Ye ma ga bea zunmazheta to ye kpe'wo kede yan na ta eti Tuci yibo na uga yi eyanwu na'atula nao.
Surah 5:93  ,                     On those who believe and do deeds of righteousness there is no blame for what they ate (in the past) when they guard themselves from evil and believe and do deeds of righteousness- (or) again guard themselves from evil and believe- (or) again guard themselves from evil and do good. For Allah loveth those who do good,Le fi danbo ta eti za nazhiga imani jin aci lo tun wangizhi dan mini yan nazhi aga gi na boa abeke aga'fe za nazhi tswa Soko naa acia imani jin aci lo tun wangizhi na gancin aci kezhe tswa Soko aci jin bolobolozhi na. Soko mae wa za nazhi gae jin bolobolo na.
Surah 5:94,                      O ye who believe! Allah doth but make a trial of you in a little matter of game well within reach of game well within reach of your hands and your lances that He may test who feareth him unseen: any who transgress thereafter will have a grievous penalty,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Akika Soko' amaye cinle be yandoci dagan mini egbe gbeo (Hajio) na egwa yezhi to ekpa yezhi'a wan ya ye na ebo Soko u la'u wu yan za na gae sundan Soko swiswoci na zandondona ma ga bea gbintu baci wuncin'o na to azaba na tan na ga'jin tabbata yau.
Surah 5:95    ,                                             O ye who believe! Kill not game while in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. If any of you doth so intentionally the compensation is an offering brought to the Ka´ba of a domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed as adjudged by two just men among you; or by way of atonement the feeding of the indigent; or its equivalent in fasts: that he may taste of the penalty of his deed. Allah forgives what is past: for repetition Allah will exact from him the penalty. For Allah is Exalted and Lord of Retribution,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega wu yankungi egbe ala'lima ya yi dan mini haramio ma zandondo na ga wu'u miniebo digangaena to ega gbau yi hadaya yan yanna uwu na be iriu yin dagan mini dabba emmizhio za guba nazhi yi eza adalincizhi na a la hukunci jin'a eti ubo.

Surah 5:96  ,                 Lawful to you is the pursuit of water-game and its use for food- for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel; but forbidden is the pursuit of land-game;- as long as ye are in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. And fear Allah to Whom ye shall be gathered back.A' egbe yan yankungi edu to yagiciu la'jin halali ya ye ulaufe eyan emawou ya ye to ezan daci yezhi.

Surah 5:97   ,                       Allah made the Ka´ba the Sacred House an asylum of security for men as also the Sacred Months the animals for offerings and the garlands that mark them: That ye may know that Allah hath knowledge of what is in the heavens and on earth and that Allah is well acquainted with all things.,Sokoa ka'aba la'afe kata Alfurma tsunwan yan kukuta yan adini ya zawangizhi to Etswa Alfurma to hadayazhi to hadaya nazhi a la yan -- koro na wuncinzhi ma ebo ye debae kpe'wo kede akika Soko yi be kpikpe yannazhifi sanmazhio na to yan nazhi fi kinbo na akika ma Soko yi be kpikpe yandondoe.Surah 5:98        Know ye that Allah is strict in punishment and that Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.Ye mae kpe wo kede akika Soko Etsu na gbota azaba na bo uyioakika ma Soko Etsu gafara uyio etsu yegun uyio.Surah 5:99          The Messenger´s duty is but to proclaim (the message). But Allah knoweth all that ye reveal and ye conceal.Yan dondo ta eti Tuci boa saide eyan wu Soko ma kpe yan nazhi ye jin tula na to yan nazhie ye jin swiswoci na.
Surah 5:100 ,             Say: "Not equal are things that are bad and things that are good even though the abundance of the bad may dazzle thee; so fear Allah O ye that understand; that (so) ye may prosper.",Gan gan: Eyan dede be eyan wangi aga fe nini'a ka da ekundo yan eyan dede gae ya wyo sha'awa na ebo acin'o e tswa Soko be dansun'uyin ya ye nazhi yi eza ankalizhi na ujin wo be wuncin'y ye ga'de rabo.
Surah 5:101   ,                     O ye who believe! Ask not questions about things which if made plain to you may cause you trouble. But if ye ask about things when the Qur´an is being revealed they will be made plain to you Allah will forgive those: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Forbearing,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:103,                    It was not Allah who instituted (superstitions like those of) a slit-ear she-camel or a she-camel let loose for free pasture or idol sacrifices for twin-births in animals or stallion-camels freed from work: It is blasphemers who invent a lie against Allah; but most of them lack wisdom,Soko la hukunci ndondo cici eti bahiraboa (Rakum yiwo gigi naa kotukpa acie wo ya kuti na) to sa'ibatu (rakum naa lo ya cie la wun kuti na eti wiwa nasarao na) to waswilatu (dabbanae wo ya kuti kamina rakum ga'ama gi ebazhi na) to hamu (rakum eba na'a kpe gwa eti wiwo ya kutio na) amma'de zanazhia jin kafirinci na e tswa ganmana tswa ta Soko ekun dondo ma ade ankalia.
Surah 5:104  ,                     When it is said to them: "Come to what Allah hath revealed; come to the Messenger": They say: "Enough for us are the ways we found our fathers following." what! even though their fathers were void of knowledge and guidance,A ma ga gan'a gan: E da beyn eba yan na Soko cin be na to eba Tuci (Soko) agan: " Yan na yi tsun Yan manciyizhi kpe eti ubona kun yikea ni Ngba!

Surah 5:105,                  O ye who believe! Guard your own souls: If ye follow (right) guidance no hurt can come to you from those who stray. the goal of you all is to Allah: it is He that will show you the truth of all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:106,                                                  O ye who believe! When death approaches any of you (take) witnesses among yourselves when making bequests- two just men of your own (brotherhood) or others from outside if ye are journeying through the earth and the chance of death befalls you (thus). If ye doubt (their truth) detain them both after prayer and let them both swear by Allah: "We wish not in this for any worldly gain even though the (beneficiary) be our near relation: we shall hide not the evidence before Allah: if we do then behold! the sin be upon us!",Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:107 ,                        But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin (of perjury) let two others stand forth in their places- nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right: let them swear by Allah: "We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two and that we have not trespassed (beyond the truth): if we did behold! the wrong be upon us!",Amma; aga bea kpedin ke zaguba'ba ajin le'fi (eri ganmana na) to a wa za guba ndocizhi agikini kingiba'bo nazhi -- yin gan zamafari zhina acia la kutiazhi be Sokoe kede: "Hakika erijin yanyi ugboka gan erijin yan'a yi ma gbin iyaka tua yima gaa gbigbintu gaskiya to hakika yi gaa fe dan mini azwalumizhio.

Surah 5:108 ,                    That is most suitable: that they may give the evidence in its true nature and shape or else they would fear that other oaths would be taken after their oaths.

Surah 6:43  ,           When the suffering reached them from us why then did they not learn humility On the contrary their hearts became hardened and Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them,To eboki'ibo kamina azaba bayiba Yi zhi be etiana aci dakpya'a yan'o Ammade yangban'azhi cia gboka shetan cia etun (dede) nazhie lo na la'apanin fia.
Surah 6:44    ,               But when they forgot the warning they had received We opened to them the gates of all (good) things until in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts on a sudden We called them to account when lo! they were plunged in despair!,Gancin kamina abea tanba la'a lo dan yannazhi ala san'atu na Yicia ekozhi kpe ya'a yan yandondo har da kamina afe fayangban (eti alfario) be yannazhi ala ya'na yi cia wan winwan yan giriku kanga ma acindan hali dede yan gigizhi boa ni.
Surah 6:46 ,                     Say: "Think ye if Allah took away your hearing and your sight and sealed up your hearts who - a god other than Allah - could restore them to you" See how We explain the signs by various (symbols); yet they turn aside.,Gan gan: Kashi ye le yea Soko ga gwo ganwo ye to bacinle yezhi be ye yin Ucia eyan la'ata yangban yezhi Tsoci kici danbo baci Soko na'alauzhin be ya ye nao Cin kendoe yie la ayazhi be ya'a kakayin na le gancin ma elaa panke eko guru lugwa.
Surah 6:47    ,         Say: "Think ye if the punishment of Allah comes to you whether suddenly or openly will any be destroyed except those who do wrong,Gan gan: Ye lr ye lea azaba yan Soko gadabe yaye kpa keteyin (be girikui) koma gbangbae ngan Sokoa jin zandondo hallaka'a sai de jama'a nazhi gayi azwalumzhi na.
Surah 6:48 ,             We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those who believe and mend (their lives)- upon them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.,Yimae tun Tucizhi tuntun'a sai de ebo abea ya (za guruzhi) buhsara ama'ajin (za dedezhi) gangba. Ebo acin'ozana gabea imani jin na ucia bolobolo la'adan etun'uzhio na to dansun ndondo danbo ya'a ama'ale yangban nyin ye a.
Surah 6:49  ,     But those who reject our signs- them shall punishment touch for that they ceased not from transgressing,Zanazhi ma aya Yizhi (zankpe Soko) yi ganmana na azaba (Soko) ga'toa ebo etun nazhi afe lo yan fasikancizhi na.
Surah 6:50  ,                         Say: "I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah nor do I know what is hidden nor do I tell you I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me." Say: "can the blind be held equal to the seeing" Will ye then consider not,Gan gan: "Mia gan ya ye gan edzunba yan arziki Soko zhi dan be mi yin'a. Mi ma de kpikpe yan na'a swo na mi ma'agan yaye gan malaika mi yia. Mide la'mitu yandondoa sai de yanna aga jin wahayiu be yami na'. Gan gan: Ngba yebonci be za nae leba ye na ga'zhe yeni Kashi ye kpaye kpa'a.
Surah 6:51  ,              Give this warning to those in whose (hearts) is the fear that they will be brought (to judgment) before their Lord: except for Him they will have no protector nor intercessor: that they may guard (against evil).,Wyo mao la wun'ojin gangbao ya zanazhi gae sundan yan kuku na'akua yekan lo eba Tsocia na ade Ndakata ndoci zunmau boa zando madanbo na'a tangwa'a na'a watakila a tswa Soko ama sundan U.
Surah 6:52     ,                   Send not away those who call on their Lord morning and evening seeking His face. In naught art thou accountable for them and in naught are they accountable for thee that thou shouldst turn them away and thus be (one) of the unjust,Wyo mao ga nyan za nazhie yi Tsocia ye to lazhin to lozun'y acie wa yarda Soko za na ma aala egagba yan etun'a ndondo gbin wyo ya'a ama'ala egagba yan etun wyoe ndondo gbin'a. Ebo acin'o wyo ga nyan'a to wyo ga'fe dan mini azwalumizhio.
Surah 6:53    ,          Thus did We try some of them by comparison with others that they should say: "Is it these then that Allah hath favoured from amongst us" Doth not Allah know best those who are grateful,Acinga gamao Yi jin sashiazhi fitina be sashiazhi ebo adeba'agangan: Ngba za nanazhi ga Soko la falala ya mini yibo Asa ujin Soko tsa kpe gan mini wuzhiuzhio za nazhi gae jin yebo yau na'a.
Surah 6:54  ,                        When those come to thee who believe in Our signs Say: "Peace be on you: Your Lord hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) mercy: verily if any of you did evil in ignorance and thereafter repented and amend (his conduct) lo! He is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Kamina ma za nazhia imani jin be aya Yizhi na gabe eba wyo na to gangan: Aminci (yan Soko) ulaujin tabbata'uta etiyebo: Tsociye wyun'a yegun la'ajin ti'ile ta etiubo ke de zandondo naga lo'tun dede mini'ebo eti rakpebo na gancin uci be'a tuba jin zunma wuncin'o tadzu na to akika Soko Etsu gafara Uyio Etsu yegun Uyio.
Surah 6:55,     Thus do We explain the signs in detail: that the way of the sinners may be shown up.,Acinga ga ma Yi ye kpe ayazhi ri kaka yin'o to ebo ma eko yan lefi jincizhi ula'u tu'ula.
Surah 6:56 ,                   Say: "I am forbidden to worship those - others than Allah - whom ye call upon." Say: "I will not follow your wain desires: If I did I would stray from the path and be not of the company of those who receive guidance.",Gan gan: Akika mi a kan mi gan mi'nga jin bauta ya za nazhi ye'jin bauta ya zuma Soko na ma. Gan gan: Mia la'mi tu etun yangban yezhia (ebo na miga jin acin) akika miga gbin. Kanga ma mia fe dan mini eza bawuzhi boa.
Surah 6:57    ,                 Say: "For me I (work) on a clear sign from my Lord but ye reject Him. What ye would see hastened is not in my power. The command rests with none but Allah: He declares the truth and He is the best of judges.",Gan gan: Mi ta eti hujjakozhi na febe dagan eba Tsoci mibo na ye mau yi ganmana. Yanna ma ye dinye gan ala be nahukunciu dangwa mi boa hukunci de undan'a sai be Sokoe wyun'e ya labari gaskiya wyun ga ma yi Etsu na gan za nazhi man yan kperi kpata nao.
Surah 6:58,             Say: "If what ye would see hastened were in my power the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But Allah knoweth best those who do wrong.",Gan gan: Akika da'aci gan yan na ye din ye'una be mi yin udan'o akika da aga hukunci ba tsakani mi bo be ye yin'ani Soko tsa ma kpe gan'o yan yanna azwalumizhi dan'y ninbo nao.
Surah 6:59 ,                             With Him are the keys of the unseen the treasures that none knoweth but He. He knoweth whatever there is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf doth fall but with His knowledge: there is not a grain in the darkness (or depths) of the earth nor anything fresh or dry (green or withered) but is (inscribed) in a record clear (to those who can read).,Ebau bo gabo giyekozhi yan eyan swiswoci kpata fio zandondo ma kpea yea sai wyun tso.

Surah 6:60,                     It is He who doth take your souls by night and hath knowledge of all that ye have done by day: by day doth He raise you up again; that a term appointed be fulfilled; In the end unto Him will be your return; then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.,Wyunga mae gwo rayi yezhi be yeshi yin'o u ma yi be kpikpe yan yannazhi ye dajin be igidi'ina gancin ma uga ye la'anakin mini ubo ebo hukunci ndoci yan lokaci nayi kikaci na gancin ma ebau gabo ezhekeba yedan'o gancin ucia yaye labari etun nazhi ye fe lo na.
Surah 6:61,                He is the irresistible (watching) from above over His worshippers and He sets guardians over you. At length when death approaches one of you Our angels take his soul and they never fail in their duty.,Wyun ga mayi Etsu na zankpeu wun'a rukpe eti wuzhiuzhio nao U mae tun (malaika) etswazhi fia harda lokaci na ajali gabe ya zaeni miniebona Tuci Yizhi cia -- rayi beayin amae ya ye dan alamari wuncin boa.
Surah 6:62 ,          Then are men returned unto Allah their protector the (only) reality: Is not His the command and He is the swiftest in taking account.,Gancin aci ga'a ku zheban da tsun Soko Ndakata'a yan gaskiya tso. E shi tukpa! Wyun ga wun hukuncio wyun ga ma yi Etsu na fan gan eba egagbao nao.
Surah 6:63   ,             Say: "Who is it that delivereth you from the dark recesses of land and sea when ye call upon Him in humility and silent terror: ´If He only delivers us from these (dangers) (we vow) we shall truly show our gratitude´",Gan gan: "Zie gwo ye tswa dagan mini bazhiko kin zhio to edu zhibo Yecia jin ye fe yiu be ekpyadae to swiswoci; kede ugayi wadzun dagan mini mimacinle nanao akika yigafe dan mini zanazhie jin yebo Soko na.
Surah 6:64     ,    Say "It is Allah that delivereth you from these and all (other) distresses: and yet ye worship false gods!",Gan gan: Soko ga wa yedzun dagan miniabo to dagan yangbanyin ndondo gancin yecie la yan pa Soko baci.
Surah 6:65  ,                        Say: "He hath power to send calamities on you from above and below or to cover you with confusion in party strife giving you a taste of mutual vengeance - each from the other." See how We explain the signs by various (symbols); that they may understand.,Gan gan: "Wyin (Soko) ga de I'ko na wyun'a tun azaba fi ye dagan etitayebo nao koma dagan tako bici yezhio koma wyun'e zhekeba kpere-kpere Uci fe ya sashiezhi masiba yan sashi zhi fin." Ngba cin le kendoe yie jin bayani ayazhi kakayin na watakila ajin fahimta (egan nazhie gan bea yin na).
Surah 6:66 ,       But thy people reject this though it is the truth. Say: "Not mine is the responsibility for arranging your affairs,Jama'a yan wyozhi ma a egan wyoe yi ganmana wuncin ga mayi gaskiyao. Gangan: Mi de jin wakili ta eti yeboa
.Surah 6:67    For every message is a limit of time and soon shall ye know it.",Labari ndondo de ekpegiba bele yin ma yea be de kpikpe.
Surah 6:68 ,                     When thou seest men engaged in vain discourse about Our signs turn away from them unless they turn to a different theme. If Satan ever makes thee forget then after recollection sit not thou in the company of those who do wrong,Wyo ma ga be le za nazhie dzo'mi fi aya Yizhi na ye to a kpe ya eba'abo har sai aga lo dan egan ndocio najin wuncin'a na. Uma gabea jin faruwa gan shetan yan tanba la'ace tu wyoe to ga kara fedun baci sinsantuo be jama'a nazhi yi azwalumizhi na ma.
Surah 6:69 ,          On their account no responsibility falls on the righteous but (their duty) is to remind them that they may (learn to) fear Allah.,Egagba yan lefi ndondo yan za na nazhie dzomi fi aya Soko na uta eti zanazhi gae tswa Soko acie sundan'u naboa amma'ade sinsantu danbo (ya atso) ujinwo atso wuncinzhi ga'afe za nazhia tswa Soko cia sundan'u na.
Surah 6:70 ,                                           Leave alone those who take their religion to be mere play and amusement and are deceived by the life of this world. But proclaim (to them) this (truth): that every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own acts: it will find for itself no protector or intercessor except Allah: if it offered every ransom (or reparation) none will be accepted: such is (the end of) those who deliver themselves to ruin by their own acts: they will have for drink (only) boiling water and for punishment one most grievous: for they persisted in rejecting Allah.,Zanazhi ma a adinia la eyan edzo be shahawa izhe na harma izhe cia ta na a ya yan'a wyo deo la Alkur'anuo san'atu.

Surah 6:71   ,                                   Say: "Shall we indeed call on others besides Allah- things that can do us neither good nor harm- and turn on our heels after receiving guidance from Allah - like one whom the evil ones have made into a fool wandering bewildered through the earth his friends calling come to us´ (vainly) guiding him to the path."

Surah 6:73  ,                     It is He who created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): the day He saith "Be" behold! it is. His word is the truth. His will be the dominion the day the trumpet will be blown. He knoweth the unseen as well as that which is open. For He is the Wise well acquainted (with all things).,Wyun ga majin alitta yan sanmazhio to kin be gaskiya yin'o to efona wyun'abe gan gan: "A fe" yandondo cia fe fe na.

Surah 6:75 ,       So also did We show Abraham the power and the laws of the heavens and the earth that he might (with understanding) have certitude.,Acinga ga Yi fe la mulkikozhi yan sanmazhi to kin wu Ibrahimao ebo ma ula'u feuda mini za nazhia gaskiya ya nao.
Surah 6:76   ,           When the night covered him over He saw a star: He said: "This is my Lord." But when it set He said: "I love not those that set.",Kamina yeshi be ala kpeuna utaye le tswangi ndoci ye uci gan: "Nana gayi Tsoci mi yin'o kamina ubea kya na ugan: Mie wa yan nazhie kya na'a.
Surah 6:77 ,                When he saw the moon rising in splendour he said: "This is my Lord." But when the moon set He said: "unless my Lord guide me I shall surely be among those who go astray.",Gancin naube le etswa ye'a la tinya na ugan: Nana gayi Tsoci mi yin'o kamina ubea kya be na ugan: Akika ka Tsoci mi wu mi baa akika mi ga'fe dan mini za gbingbinci zhio.
Surah 6:78 ,               When he saw the sun rising in splendour he said: "This is my Lord; this is the greatest (of all)." But when the sun set he said: "O my people! I am indeed free from your (guilt) of giving partners to Allah.,Kamina ube le igidi ye a la tinya na ugan: Nana gayi Tsoci mi yin'o nana ga wancin gan'o Gancin na ubea kya na ugan: ya ye jama'a yan mizhi!

Surah 6:80,                        His people disputed with him. He said: "(Come) ye to dispute with me about Allah when He (Himself) hath guided me I fear not (the beings) ye associate with Allah: Unless my Lord willeth (nothing can happen). My Lord comprehendeth in His knowledge all things. Will ye not (yourselves) be admonished,Jama'a yan'uzhi ci gbomi beu yin.

Surah 6:83 ,            That was the reasoning about Us which We gave to Abraham (to use) against his people: We raise whom We will degree after degree: for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge,Wuncin ma ugayi daliliko yizhio yimau la'aya Ibrahima ta eti jama'auzhio.

Surah 6:84  ,                  We gave him Isaac and Jacob: all (three) guided: and before him We guided Noah and among his progeny David Solomon Job Joseph Moses and Aaron: thus do We reward those who do good:,Yima twarya yau be (egi) Ishaqae to Ya'a kubu kpata ma yia wuba to Nuhu yiu wuba shidzo batsozhiodagan mini zuriauzhio ma Dawuda danbo to Ayuba to Yusufu to Musa to Haruna acinga gama yie la egagba ya zanazhi gae lo'tun wangizhi nao.

Surah 6:88   ,            This is the guidance of Allah: He giveth that guidance to whom He pleaseth of His worshippers. If they were to join other gods with Him all that they did would be vain for them.,Wuncin ma bawu yan Soko uyio wyun'e la'u wu zana gabau na ba mini wuzhiu zhio.

Say: "Allah (sent it down)": Then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling.,A ma la tsunwan ya Soko eti hakki yan tsunwan nagwo'u yin na'a kamina a gan gan: "Soko cin yan dondo be ya zawangi ndondoa" Gangan: "Zi'i cin litafi na Musa be beyin ucia fe haske be bawu'I ya zawangizhi ye cie lau fe takadazhi ye lau tu ye mae swo na dokun nao Ama wu ye yanna yede kpikpea'na to ye to Babaezhiio" Gangan: "Soko" Gancin wyocio la'ao yaodan dzolo-dzolozhin'abo a fea dzo-dzo.

Surah 6:94     ,                       "And behold! ye come to us bare and alone as We created you for the first time: ye have left behind you all (the favours) which We bestowed on you: We see not with you your intercessors whom ye thought to be partners in your affairs: so now all relations between you have been cut off and your (pet) fancies have left you in the lurch!",Akika ma ye kezhe dabe eba Yi yiani zaeninni kendoe yi jin alittaye tun dagan kakancae na.

Surah 6:95 ,               It is Allah Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causeth the living to issue from the dead and He is the one to cause the dead to issue from the living. That is Allah: then how are ye deluded away from the truth,Akika Soko gayi Etsu nae kpe eyi-sunsun misun cie tinya nao to kwosun wyun'e la eyan be rayi tinya dagan mini eyan tsutsucio umae la eyan tsutsuci tinya dagan mini eyan nayibe rayi na.

Surah 6:96  ,         He it is that cleaveth the day-break (from the dark): He makes the night for rest and tranquillity and the sun and moon for the reckoning (of time): Such is the judgment and ordering of (Him) the Exalted in Power the Omniscient.,Etsu nae la batin tinya na ucie la yeshi la'shi tsuuyin na to yigidi to etswa ma acia fe yannazhie jin lisafi na. Wuncin tsunwan dan uyio yan i'ko Etsu zankpe Etsu kpikpe.
Surah 6:97,               It is He Who maketh the stars (as beacons) for you that ye may guide yourselves with their help through the dark spaces of land and sea: We detail Our signs for people who know,Wyun ga ma la tswangizhi shishio ebo ye lae de bawu bea yin dan mini bazhikozhio to yan kin to eduo. Akika Yi yia ayazhi kpeye ka ka yin (be bayani) ya zanazhi gayi eza kpikpezhi na.
Surah 6:98,            It is He Who hath produced you from a single person: here is a place of sojourn and a place of departure: We detail Our signs for people who understand.,Wyun ga ma tswa alitta ye tinya dagan mini rayi ninibo ade nazhia fedun yizhe na ama de nazhia gwogan gwo lo eku na. Akika Yi yia ayazhi kpeye ya ye kakayin ya zanazhi gayi eza fahimtazhi na (za nazhi egan'e dada yea na).
Surah 6:99,                                           It is He Who sendeth down rain from the skies: with it We produce vegetation of all kinds: from some We produce green (crops) out of which We produce grain heaped up (at harvest); out of the date-palm and its sheaths (or spathes) (come) clusters of dates hanging low and near: and (then there are) gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates each similar (in kind) yet different (in variety): when they begin to bear fruit feast your eyes with the fruit and the ripeness thereof. Behold! in these things there are signs for people who believe.,Wyun ga mayi Etsu nae du'le be dagan sanmao nao gancin yicie lau la'a nyin yangici sunsunzhi irindondo tinya Yicie la tinya dagan miniubo na yi nuwan fini-fini na Yi cie wa yangici sunsun nazhi tu dozhi na to dagan mini dobinao dagan mini cigban gbereu zhiogwalagi dobinazhi nazhia labadozhi aci tsoba kin na danbo to batazhi yan sunsun inabizhi to emi zaytunizhi to rumanuzhi ade nazhi be dozhina to nazhi be dozhia na.

Surah 6:100    ,          Yet they make the Jinns equals with Allah though Allah did create the Jinns; and they falsely having no knowledge attribute to Him sons and daughters. Praise and glory be to Him! (for He is) above what they attribute to Him!,A cia yandocizhi la'apa Soko baci (mini) jannuzhio wyun (Soko) gama jin alitta'ao. A cia egi bagizhi to yinzagizhi sa'aya Soko eti rakpe bo. Lili kpata ajin tabbata yau! Soko ma'a latu ke yannazhi e' la'a jiu ye na lugwa.
Surah 6:101 ,                To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: How can He have a son when He hath no consort He created all things and He hath full knowledge of all things.,Etsu na ca jinjin yan sanmazhi to kin na. Ke wun'a yiyi uci de'gi nao alali ma ude yinmi ndondo'a naa yin'o wyunga ma jin alitta yandondo nao Soko ma Etsu uyio na yi be kpikpe yandondoe na.
Surah 6:102,               That is Allah your Lord! there is no god but He the Creator of all things: then worship ye Him: and He hath power to dispose of all affairs.,Wyuncin ga yi Soko na yi Tsoci ye nao ade Tsoci ndondo na'awun be gaskiyae na sai wyun'y Etsu na jin alitta yandondo na ebo acin'o ejin bauta yau.

Surah 6:103,        No vision can grasp Him but His grasp is over all vision: He is above all comprehension yet is acquainted with all things.Bayeleszhi (eyezhi) a leuye woa wyun ma wyun'e le bayelezhi kpata ye. Wyun ma Etsu tosayi uyio Etsu kpikpe.
Surah 6:104  ,            "Now have come to you from your Lord proofs (to open your eyes): if any will see it will be for (the good of) his own soul; if any will be blind it will be to his own (harm): I am not (here) to watch over your doings.",Akikaeyan yekpazhi be yaye dagan eba tsoci yebo to zana ga be shi tsu'uyin uci kpaye na to wuncin yi ebo tiubo zana maga bayeleu na uci kpayea na wyuntso ga wun'a yao mi majin zana'afe tswa ye tswa za na'a.
Surah 6:105 ,      Thus do we explain the signs by various (symbols): that they may say "Thou hast taught (us) diligently" and that We may make the matter clear to those who know.Acinga gama yie zhe ayazhi gwao ebo ma a gangan: ",Wyo gba katun nna gba (litafi ndocio)" ebo ma yi la wyun'ijin bayani ya jama'a nazhi gayi eza kpikpezhi na.
Surah 6:106  ,          Follow what thou art taught by inspiration from thy Lord: there is no god but He: and turn aside from those who join gods with Allah.,Amitu yan na aga jin wahayiu be ya wyoe dagan eba Tsoci wyobo na: Ade yandondo na'ajin bauta ya na sai de wyun'y wyo mao lao kpeo ya be zanazhie la yan pa Soko ba ci nae. 
Surah 6:107   ,         If it had been Allah´s plan they would not have taken false gods: but We made thee not one to watch over their doings nor art thou set over them to dispose of their affairs.,Uma'a ba Soko ba da'a ala yan pau bacia Yima la wyoe fe tati'abo gan wyo feo tswa'ao za'a Yima la wyo fe wakili ta eti aboa.https://play.google.com/store/apps/detailsid=com.noorlab.alquran
Surah 6:108,                        Revile not ye those whom they call upon besides Allah lest they out of spite revile Allah in their ignorance. Thus have We made alluring to each people its own doings. In the end will they return to their Lord and We shall then tell them the truth of all that they did.,Ye mae ga gi zanazhie wun yandoci ke Soko lugwa na toko ma kacin'a agi Soko toko eti ragbanzhi be rakpeboe. Acinga ga Yila ninpa dan etun (dede) ya alumma ndondo gancin ma ezhekeba'a uyi lo eba Tsocia Ucia ya'a labari be iri etun nazhi afe lo na.
Surah 6:109  ,                  They swear their strongest oaths by Allah that if a (special) sign came to them by it they would believe. Say: "Certainly (all) signs are in the power of Allah: but what will make you (Muslims) realise that (even) if (special) signs came they will not believe.",Ama zhikuti be Sokoda iyaka yan kutizhia zhi ke de akika aga imani jin beuyin na gangan: "Hakika zankpe dan be zandondo yin'a sai be Sokoe.

.Surah 6:110  ,          We (too) shall turn to (confusion) their hearts and their eyes even as they refused to believe in this in the first instance: We shall leave them in their trespasses to wander in distraction.,Yi mae zhe yangban'azhi ban (ke fahimta wangi lugwa) kendoe de tun dagan caba batso zhio a yegan ajin imania na. Yicia ya gun mini pipeazhio acia gizhi.
Surah 6:112   ,                   Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy- evil ones among men and jinns inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception. If thy Lord had so planned they would not have done it: so leave them and their inventions alone.,Acinga gama Yila ezananvozhi (makinzhi) mini shetan yan zawangizhi to jannuzhi a fe ya Annabi ndondo sashizhi cie jin wahayi ya sashi be egan dede nazhia panin naeti de etao Uma gaba Tsoci wyo ba da atsoa jin wun'a eboacin'o a ya be ganmana nazhie tswa nae.
Surah 6:113 ,          To such (deceit) let the hearts of those incline who have no faith in the hereafter: let them delight in it and let them earn from it what they may.,To ebo ma yangban yan za nazhi jin imani be efozoba yin'a na ulau kan'uda eba'be tukpa shiy eboma ala yeda'ajin beayin ebo ma adeba'ajin lefi nazhi aga'ajin na.
Surah 6:114   ,                   Say: "Shall I seek for judge other than Allah - when He it is Who hath sent unto you the Book explained in detail." They know full well to whom We have given the Book that it hath been sent down from thy Lord in truth. Never be then of those who doubt.,Ngba zandoci zunma Soko ga miada waza na'ajin hukunci (eti edun fe izheo nao) alalima wyunga yi Etsu na cin litafi be ya ye nae kpe ganzhi ye kakayin nao Zanazhi ma yi la litafi ya na e-kpeuye kede eba Tsoci wyobo acin'ube be gaskiya yin'o'na eboain'o ga fe dan mini zanazhie jin kelokezhin nao ma.
Surah 6:115,          The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfilment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all.,Egan yan (hukunci) Tsoci wyo ma wun'a gunmiani be gaskiyae be adalinci zandondo danbo na'ala egwasan dan hukunciuzhi wo na'a wyun ga ma yi Etsu nae wo na'o Etsu kpikpe.
Surah 6:116    ,             Wert thou to follow the common run of those on earth they will lead thee away from the way of Allah. They follow nothing but conjecture: they do nothing but lie.,Wyoma ga-mi tu kundondo za nazhi kpe eti kinbo na agao gbin ke eko Soko lugwa. Ade yandondoe la'mitua saide yekpa amade yandondoe jin'a sai ganmana.
Surah 6:117  ,        Thy Lord knoweth best who strayeth from His way: He knoweth best who they are that receive His guidance.,Akika Tsoci wyoe ga kpe gan'o yan zanazhie gbin ke ekou lugwa na'o wyun ga ma kpe gan'o yan zanazhia ke eko gboro na'o.
Surah 6:118 ,        So eat of (meats) on which Allah´s name hath been pronounced if ye have faith in His signs.,Ye mae fe gi dagan mini (eyanzunzunci) na aga tun sunna Soko ye ta etiubo na yega'fe gan ye ya imani jin be atau zhi na.
Surah 6:119  ,                           Why should ye not eat of (meats) on which Allah´s name hath been pronounced when He hath explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you - except under compulsion of necessity But many do mislead (men) by their appetites unchecked by knowledge. Thy Lord knoweth best those who transgress.,Ki-ma jin ye yeo yecia gi yanna atun sunna Soko ye ta eti uboa na' yin'o alalima wyun'a eganzhi kpe ye ya ye kaka yin yan nazhi ulaji haramu na ya ye yeani nao Saide ena ti'ilebo ga bea de ye lo ebau na akika ma ekundondo zazhi e-kuzazhi fi egbin'o be etun yangban'azhi eti rakpe bo.

Surah 6:120 ,          Eschew all sin open or secret: those who earn sin will get due recompense for their "earnings.",Ye mae ke gan be lemba Sokoe to yan gbangba to yan swiswoci. Akika zanazhie cewo lemba Soko na a ga'a gba be iri yannazhi a fe jin na.
Surah 6:121   ,                Eat not of (meats) on which Allah´s name hath not been pronounced: That would be impiety. But the evil ones ever inspire their friends to contend with you if ye were to obey them ye would indeed be Pagans.,Ye mae ga gi dagan mini (eyan zunzunci) naa tun sunna Soko ye ta etiuboa na ma akika wuncin fasikanci uyio.

.Surah 6:122,                       Can he who was dead to whom We gave life and a light whereby he can walk amongst men be like him who is in the depths of darkness from which he can never come out Thus to those without faith their own deeds seem pleasing,Ngba za na'afe eyan tsutsuci na ganci Yiciu dan rayi Yici ke zhea haske la'ayau na wyu'a fe la dazan dan tacin zawangizhiona ngba zawuncin ga'azhe ye ni be dozhin'u na gun mini bazhikozhio nama wyun'a dzun boa na Acinga ga e-la ninpa dan etun dedezhi ya kafirizhio.
Surah 6:123,              Thus have We placed leaders in every town its wicked men to plot (and burrow) therein: but they only plot against their own souls and they perceive it not.,Acinga ga ma Yi laufe dan alkarya ndondo bo gbangban yan dzoshiciazhi aga yi lefi jinci gbonta zhio ebo adeba pa makirinci dedezhi a dan miniubo a ma'ade makirinci dede na'apa na'a sai de na'agia tso rayizhi naatso mae wo sansan wuncin'a.
Surah 6:124  ,                          When there comes to them a sign (from Allah) They say: "We shall not believe until we receive one (exactly) like those received by Allah´s messengers." Allah knoweth best where (and how) to carry out His mission. Soon will the wicked be overtaken by humiliation before Allah and a severe punishment for all their plots.,Kamina ma a ya gabe ya'a (nae wu zan kpe Soko) na a gan: 'yi yia ajin imania sai aga be yayi be iri yannazhi alaya tuci Soko zhi na'.

Surah 6:125 ,                          Those whom Allah (in His plan) willeth to guide- He openeth their breast to Islam; those whom He willeth to leave straying- He maketh their breast close and constricted as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth Allah (heap) the penalty on those who refuse to believe.,Ebo acin'o zana Soko gae kpa gan wyun'a lau ke eko na Uga yan gban'u la'a fe gwi gwoci ya musulunci zana ma uga'akpa ci gan wyuan yaugun egbin'o na uga yangban'u lazhe pinpinci uci g'yiku ke wyoa gan gan wyun'e gun sanma gun na Acinga ga Sokoa jin ula shikan kpe eti zanazhie jin imani a na'o.
Surah 6:126 ,       This is the way of thy Lord leading straight: We have detailed the signs for those who receive admonition.,Nana gayi ekpa Tso ci wyoe nayi gboro na'o. Akika Yia ayazhi kpe ye kakayin ya jama nazhie gwo sinsantu na.
Surah 6:127,         For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord: He will be their friend because they practised (righteousness).,(Zawuncizhi) Ayi be emi yan aminci dan eba Tsocia bo wun ga ma yi Ndakata'ao ebo iri etun nazhi afe lo na.
Surah 6:128  ,                                One day will He gather them all together (and say): "O ye assembly of Jinns! Much (toll) did ye take of men." Their friends amongst men will say: "Our Lord! we made profit from each other: but (alas!) we reached our term - which thou didst appoint for us." He will say: "The Fire be your dwelling-place: you will dwell therein for ever except as Allah willeth." for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.,Fo na ma Uga'kua yekan baenio na (Wyun'a gan gan) "ya ye jama' yan jannuzhi!

Surah 6:129,       Thus do we make the wrong-doers turn to each other because of what they earn.,Acinga ga ma Yia jin Yeiela edzoshi yizhe yan sashi azwalumizhi a dan sashiazhi gwabo ebo iri etun dede nazhie lo na.
Surah 6:130,                          "O ye assembly of Jinns and men! came there not unto you messengers from amongst you setting forth unto you My signs and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours" They will say: "We bear witness against ourselves." It was the life of this world that deceived them. So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected Faith.,Ya ye jama'a yan jannuzhi to zawangizhi! Asa Tucizhi be yaye dagan mini yeboa acie ya labari yan aya Mizhi ya ye yea acie na ye wun eti gungun nyan ye be efo ye nana yin'a A cigan: 'yi de jin ri ta eti tacin yi tso.

Surah 6:131,         (The messengers were sent) thus for thy Lord would not destroy for their wrong-doing men´s habitations whilst their occupants were unwarned.,Wuncin ma'afe ebo na Tsoci wyoe wyun'ajin alkarya ndondo hallaka eti zwaluncio alali-ma jamaa yan kinzhi kpea yan'a.
Surah 6:132 ,       To all are degrees (or ranks) according to their deeds: for thy Lord is not unmindful of anything that they do.,Al'umma ndondo ma uyi be darajauzhi dagan mini etun nazhi aga lo na. Tsoci wyo ma ufe Etsu nae ya ye ke etun nazhi ye lo na lugwaa.
Surah 6:133,                 Thy Lord is self-sufficient full of Mercy: if it were His will He could destroy you and in your place appoint whom He will as your successors even as He raised you up from the posterity of other people.,Tsoci wyo ma Etsu bagwo uyio na de ye gun na. Uga bau Ugae fin ya (baenio) Ucia jin zandondo na ga bau na kendoe de ndocizhio kayin na.
Surah 6:134,      All that hath been promised unto you will come to pass: nor can ye frustrate it (in the least bit).,Akika yannazhi e la jin ye alkawali na akika wun'a da be ye ma jin zanazhi gangwa na'a.Surah 6:135                 Say: "O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): soon will ye know who it is whose end will be (best) in the Hereafter: certain it is that the wrong-doers will not prosper."Gan gan: Ya ye jama'a yan mi zhi!

Surah 6:136,                              Out of what Allah hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle they assigned Him a share: they say according to their fancies: "This is for Allah and this" - for our "partners"! but the share of their" partners "reacheth not Allah whilst the share of Allah reacheth their "partners" ! evil (and unjust) is their assignment!,Acia kansan ndo ci la'a shi shi ya Soko dagan mini yan na udzoyan'a nyan yan gi ci latizhi to dabbazhi naaci gan: Nana ma yan kuti yizhi a yio.

Surah 6:137 ,                  Even so in the eyes of most of the pagans their "partners" made alluring the slaughter of their children in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion. If Allah had willed they would not have done so: But leave alone them and their inventions.,Acinga ga ma yannazhie la pa Soko baci na a ninpa la'adan ya ekun dondo mushirikizhi wuwu yan egi azhi ebo adeba'ala ajin hallaka ama'ala rikicia la'adan adiniaboa ya'a.

Surah 6:138,                         And they say that such and such cattle and crops are taboo and none should eat of them except those whom - so they say - We wish; further there are cattle forbidden to yoke or burden and cattle on which (at slaughter) the name of Allah is not pronounced; - inventions against Allah´s name: soon will He requite them for their inventions.,Amagan: yannazhi fi gbako yan dabba nanazhio na tsitsaci uyio ya bagi yizhi uma yi eyan kinkanci (haramu) ya yinmi yizhi.

Surah 6:139  ,                   They say: "What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is specially reserved (for food) for our men and forbidden to our women; but if it is still-born then all have share therein. For their (false) attribution (of superstitions to Allah) He will soon punish them: for He is full of wisdom and knowledge.,Akika zanazhi san wawa cia egiazhi wu eti rakpebo na ajin hasara. Acia arziki na Soko ya'na la'ajin haramu ya tia eti ganmana na'atswa ta Soko na akika a'gbin ama fe zanazhi ke eko na'a.
Surah 6:140   ,                Lost are those who slay their children from folly without knowledge and forbid food which Allah hath provided for them inventing (lies) against Allah. They have indeed gone astray and heeded no guidance.,Wyun ga ma yi etsu na ca jin jin cigban latizhi na'o ndocizhi wunkpa be wuruzhi to ndocizhi nazhi de wurua na to dobinazhi to eyandzozhi nazhi yangiciazhia kperi be dozhi na to nazhi be dozhia na E gi dagan mini yangicisunsun'uzhio kamina aga nyin tin ya na ye mae la hakkiuzhie wa fona ye ga da ku yangici lati na yemae ga nyin yangici ya ma Akika ma Sokoe wa za nazhi gae nyin yan na'a.
Surah 6:141   ,                           It is He Who produceth gardens with trellises and without and dates and tilth with produce of all kinds and olives and pomegranates similar (in kind) and different (in variety): eat of their fruit in their season but render the dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered. But waste not by excess: for Allah loveth not the wasters.,Mini dabbazhio ma ade nazhie la karazhi na to nazhi ye ta cici cie zun gi na egi dagan mini arziki na Soko la yaye nao ye mae ga lamitu ekpa shetan zhi ma.

Surah 6:142,               Of the cattle are some for burden and some for meat: eat what Allah hath provided for you and follow not the footsteps of Satan: for he is to you and avowed enemy.,Iri gutwota a yio dagan mini yan wurezhio ade guba amade guba dagan mini kingbagbazhio.

Here is a similitude: How rain and the growth which it brings forth delight (the hearts of) the tillers; soon it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then it becomes dry and crumbles away. But in the Hereafter is a Penalty severe (for the devotees of wrong). And Forgiveness from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure (for the devotees of Allah). And what is the life of this world but goods and chattels of deception,Ye kpe wo ke de edunfe izhe edzo uyio to shagala jin tsakaniebo be dozhi be wiwa yan bibe yan dukiyazhi be egizhiy ke kwatonkwoci ele nan uyio nan eyandzo'uzhi fe ya enunucizhi shiawa na gancin ucia bea wo wyo cia leu ye dzuru-dzuruy uci gazhe yan nan de anfa'ni bea nan.

But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves We did not prescribe for them: (We commanded) only the seeking for the Good Pleasure of Allah; but that they did not foster as they should have done. Yet We bestowed on those among them who believed their (due) reward but many of them are rebellious transgressors.,Yici kezhea Tuci Yizhi gba'a zunmao Yicia (Annabi) Isa egi Maryamu gbaa zunmao be Yicia Litafi yan Linjeela la'a yau Yicia tosayi be yegun'y laadan yangban yan za nanzhia emi tu'u nan.

Surah 57:29  ,                   That the People of the Book may know that they have no power whatever over the Grace of Allah that (His) Grace is (entirely) in His Hand to bestow it on whomsoever He wills. For Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding.,Ebo za ba Litafi zhi'a kpe'a wo ke de a de kagbo ndondo eti eryatwa Soko boa nan akika ma eryatwa kpata be Soko yin'u dan'o wun'e lau ya za nan ga bau nan akika Soko Etsu rryatwa uyio nan wancin nan.
﻿Surah 58:1       ,           Allah has indeed heard (and accepted) the statement of the woman who pleads with thee concerning her husband and carries her complaint (in prayer) to Allah: and Allah (always) hears the arguments between both sides among you: for Allah hears and sees (all things).,Akika Soko wo gan yan eza ynzagi nae gan lo gan-zhin be wyo yin eti egan eba'u bo nan. Ucie jin kara lo eba Soko. Soko mae wo eza yezhi. Akika Soko Etsu nae wo gan nan uyio Etsu nae le ba ye nan uyio.
Surah 58:2    ,                  If any men among you divorce their wives by Zihar (calling them mothers) they cannot be their mothers: None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth. And in fact they use words (both) iniquitous and false: but truly Allah is one that blots out (sins) and forgives (again and again),.Za nanzhie jin zihari mini yebo be yinmiazhiy nan (aajin afe'la yinmin'azhi san tatu be nna'azhi nna'zhi yan akika a ga yi nanzhiy ma'a nao. Akika a de gan gan dedezhi tinya misun'o a mae zun ganmanan zun. Akika Soko Etsu sauki uyio Etsu gafara uyio.
Surah 58:3         ,           But those who divorce their wives by Zihar then wish to go back on the words they uttered- (It is ordained that such a one) should free a slave before they touch each other: Thus are ye admonished to perform: and Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.,Za nanzhiy ma ga zihari jin be yinmiazhiy nan acia jin ake dazhin eti egan na'gan nan( ke uyi acin'a na) hukunci nan ta etiabo nan u ga yi gan a la wuzhi a ya gi shidzo kafi a la egwa'atu yinmiazhi nan. Wuncin ga yi yan nan e la jin ye waazi nao Soko ma yi be Labari yan etun nanzhi ye lo kpata nan.
Surah 58:4          ,               And if any has not (the wherewithal) he should fast for two months consecutively before they touch each other. But if any is unable to do so he should feed sixty indigent ones this that ye may show your faith in Allah and His Messenger. Those are limits (set by) Allah. For those who reject (Him) there is a grievous Penalty.,Gancin za nan be dewuzhia nan u la azum yan etswa guba nanzhiy lamitu dozhi nan'u fe kafi'u la egwa'u tu yinmiu nan.

Surah 58:5  ,               Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be humbled to dust as were those before them: for We have already sent down Clear Signs. And the Unbelievers (will have) a humiliating Penalty-,Akika za nanzhie le Soko be Tuciu yin ba nan a ga'a gba kendoe za nanazhiy shiadzo nan gba nan akika Yi'a aya nanzhi tula nan cin bea ya wye akika ma azaba yan zun yesun a jin tabbata ya kafirizhi.
Surah 58:6        ,      On the Day that Allah will raise them all up (again) and show them the Truth (and meaning) of their conduct. Allah has reckoned its (value) though they may have forgotten it for Allah is Witness to all things.,Fo nan Soko ga'a na'akin baenio nan wun'a ya' labari yan etun nanzhiy a lo nan Soko'u gwo tswa a ma'a batan akika Sokoe jin eri eti yandondo.
Surah 58:7         ,                                     Seest thou not that Allah doth know (all) that is in the heavens and on earth There is not a secret consultation between three but He makes the fourth among them - Nor between five but He makes the sixth- nor between fewer nor more but He is in their midst wheresoever they be: In the end will He tell them the truth of their conduct on the Day of Judgment. For Allah has full knowledge of all things.,Kashi wyo le ye gan Soko kpikpe yan yannanzhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo na'a A de eza swiswoci tsakani za guta boa sai de Soko gaa fe nicia a maa yi za gutsun Soko gaafe tswanayin cia ka aga gbagba gan'acin ko aci gan'acin sai Wun'a dan gancin Ucia'ya'a labari yan etun nanzhi a lo nan efo alkiyamiy.

Surah 58:8          ,                           Turnest thou not thy sight towards those who were forbidden secret counsels yet revert to that which they were forbidden (to do) And they hold secret counsels among themselves for iniquity and hostility and disobedience to the Messenger. And when they come to thee they salute thee not as Allah salutes thee (but in crooked ways): And they say to themselves "Why does not Allah punish us for our words" Enough for them is Hell: In it will they burn and evil is that destination!,Ngba Wyo le za nanzhi a kan'a gan a aga baza swiswoci na ma ye'a Gancin aci kezhe eti yannan akan'a gan a ga jin na ma a cie baza swiswoci eti le fio be gbin gbin tuy be lemba yan Tuciy.

Surah 58:9  ,                O ye who believe! When ye hold secret counsel do it not for iniquity and hostility and disobedience to the Prophet; but do it for righteousness and self-restraint; and fear Allah to Whom ye shall be brought back.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan kami nan ye ga'a baza swiswoci nan e ga baza eti le fio be gbingintuy be lemba Tuciy ma e baza eti emi latu Soko be dansun Sokoe yemae fe tswa Soko Etsu nan eba'u ga ye'a kezhe lo nan.
Surah 58:10 ,               Secret counsels are only (inspired) by the Evil One in order that he may cause grief to the Believers; but he cannot harm them in the least except as Allah permits; and on Allah let the Believers put their trust.,Akika ezabaswiswoci (eti lefio) dagan eba Sheitan bo wun'e fe beo ebo yangban yan zananzhia imani jin nan ula'u nyin u ma jin'a egun ndondo woa sai be izini Sokoe Soko ga ma Muminizhi a ya kpe kawan yin'o.
Surah 58:11     ,                        O ye who believe! When ye are told to make room in the assemblies (spread out and) make room: (ample) room will Allah provide for you. And when ye are told to rise up rise up Allah will rise up to (suitable) ranks (and degrees) those of you who believe and who have been granted (mystic) Knowledge. And Allah is well-acquainted with all ye do.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan a ga gan ye gan ye; kpe ba'e ya'a edunfe bao e kpe ba ya'a Soko akpe ba ya yetso ga.

Surah 58:12       ,              O ye who believe! When ye consult the Messenger in private spend something in charity before your private consultation. That will be best for you and most conducive to purity (of conduct). But if ye find not (the wherewithal) Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan kami nan ye ga'baza be Tuciy nan ye'a sadaka la'a shidzo be-dzo. Wuncin ga yi alheri ya ye yeo u ma tadzu gan. Kagan ye be de'a akika Soko Etsu gafara u yio Etsu yegun u yio.
Surah 58:13         ,              Is it that ye are afraid of spending sums in charity before your private consultation (with him) If then ye do not so and Allah forgives you then (at least) establish regular prayer; practise regular charity; and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.,Kashiy ye sundan sun (yan yaji) ye ga sadaka la'a Shidzo kafi ye baza nan Kagan ye be jin'a Soko cia fa be ye yin yea swallah ku gikini ye mae la zakkae wa ye mae la mietu Soko be Tuci uyio akika Soko de labari etun nanzhiy ye lo nan.
Surah 58:14       ,           Turnest thou not thy attention to those who turn (in friendship) to such as have the Wrath of Allah upon them They are neither of you nor of them and they swear to falsehood knowingly.,Ngba Wyo le za nanzhi'a jama'a nan zhi Soko a zhe wun be yin nan la ndakatazhi nan ye'a Za wuncinzhi a dan mini ye boa a ma dan mini'a boa.

Surah 58:15  ,       Allah has prepared for them a severe Penalty: evil indeed are their deeds.,Sokoa shiri yan azaba nan tan nan jin ka'a akika etun nanzhiy e lo nan wun'a bi ye.
Surah 58:16      ,   They have made their oaths a screen (for their misdeeds): thus they obstruct (men) from the Path of Allah: therefore shall they have a humiliating Penalty.,A' kuti nanzhiy e zhi nan la ke garkuwa nan acia eko Soko kan'eza yn da azaba yan zunyesun wun'a jin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 58:17    ,          Of no profit whatever to them against Allah will be their riches nor their sons: they will be Companions of the Fire to dwell therein (for aye)!,Duki-yaazhi to egizhi a' kunke ya'be yandondoe eba Soko boa. Zawuncinzhi ma a ga yi egi mi na zhio ba ga bo a fi tu tun yin'o.
Surah 58:18   ,             One day will Allah raise them all up (for Judgment): then will they swear to Him as they swear to you: And they think that they have something (to stand upon). No indeed! they are but liars!,Fo nan Soko gaa ku nankin bae nio nan acia fe zhi kuti ya'u kendoe e zhi kuti ya ye nan acia fe kpaye gan eti yandoci (nan gboka nan) bo a tao A'a ujin'acin'a akika ganmanan zuncizhi a yio.
Surah 58:19  ,            The Evil One has got the better of them: so he has made them lose the remembrance of Allah. They are the Party of the Evil One. Truly it is the Party of the Evil One that will perish!,Sheitan'yin'a rukpea U cia tanba yan pipa Soko la'a ce taa za wuncizhi ga yi jama'a yan sheitan zhio akika ma jama'a yan sheitan ga yi eza hasarazhio.
Surah 58:20    ,   Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be among those most humiliated.,Akika za nanzhie le Soko be Tuci'u yin ba nan a ga yi eza gbigbaci zhio.
Surah 58:21  ,      Allah has decreed: "It is I and My messengers who must prevail": For Allah is One full of strength able to enforce His Will.,Sokoe hukunci ba gan akika Mi ga de (galaba) zankpe to Mi to Tuci Mizhi. Akika Soko Etsu kagbo u yio Etsu zankpe u yio.
Surah 58:22  ,                                                Thou wilt not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day loving those who resist Allah and His Messenger even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. For such He has written Faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow to dwell therein (for ever). Allah will be well pleased with them and they with Him. They are the Party of Allah. Truly it is the Party of Allah that will achieve Felicity.,Wyo'a tsun jama'a nanzhia imani jin be Sokoe be efo zobae nan a fe de cincin ya za nae le Soko be Tuci'u yin ba na'a ka agafe mimaazhi ko egiazhi ko yegiazhi ko dangiazhi.

Surah 59:2       ,                                It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces). Little did ye think that they would get out: And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But the (Wrath of) Allah came to them from quarters from which they little expected (it) and cast terror into their hearts so that they destroyed their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the Believers take warning then O ye with eyes (to see)!,Wun ga nyan kafirizhi mini zaba Litafizhi tin ya dagan emi'azhi bo ebo gungun yekan yan mafari bo.

Surah 59:3  ,           And had it not been that Allah had decreed banishment for them He would certainly have punished them in this world: And in the Hereafter they shall (certainly) have the Punishment of the Fire.,Kagan ujin ebo nan Sokoa nyin-nyan ka ta etiabo na'a da U gaa jin azaba dede izheo azaba yan ena maga' jin tabbata ya'a ekuo
Surah 59:4    ,       That is because they resisted Allah and His Messenger: and if any one resists Allah verily Allah is severe in Punishment.,Wuncin ma yi ebo nan a le Soko be Tuci'u yin ba nan zandondo na ma ga'a le Soko ba nan Soko Etsu tsun tsunnu u yio.
Surah 59:5     ,       Whether ye cut down (O ye Muslim!) The tender palm-trees or ye left them standing on their roots it was by leave of Allah and in order that He might cover with shame the rebellious transgresses.,Cigan ndondo nan ye ga nan ko ma ye ci'u ya gikini gbaro eti gbere'u bo nan sai de be izini yan Sokoe wuncin yi ebo u'la faskizhi'u sun zunye.
Surah 59:6    ,                    What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger (and taken away) from them - for this ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: but Allah gives power to His messengers over any He pleases: and Allah has power over all things.,Yan nan ma Soko ga nasara'u la'ucia ya Tuci'u mini (dukiya)kafirizhio nanye gun kun gunbe dokozhi ko ma yan-tuci ndoci boa akika Skoe la kagbo'u Tuci'u zhi ta eti iza nan ga bau nan Akika Soko de kangbo ta eti yandondo.
Surah 59:7        ,                            What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger (and taken away) from the people of the townships- belongs to Allah- to His Messenger and to kindred and orphans the needy and the wayfarer; In order that it may not (merely) make a circuit between the wealthy among you. So take what the Messenger assigns to you and deny yourselves that which he withholds from you. And fear Allah; for Allah is strict in Punishment.,Yan nan zhiy Soko ga nasarau la'a ya Tuciu mini alkaryazhio nan Soko wun dan miniu bo to Tuciu to za nanzhiy tsoba nan to ekungizhi to eza gwa gbagizhi to ezan daci ebo dukiya be'azhe yan nae dan yi dangwa ewodecizhio nama.

Surah 59:8           ,      (Some part is due) to the indigent Muhajirs those who were expelled from their homes and their property while seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure and aiding Allah and His Messenger: such are indeed the sincere ones:-,(A ma kezhe'a la' ya) talakazhiy nanzhia kpela nan nanzhiy a nyan tinya ezhia zhio nan acia gan be dukiyazhiy nan. A'a jin afe wa eryatwa Soko be yedan yin za.A maajin a fe jin (Eko Soko) be Tuci'u yin taimako nan Akika za wuncinzhi ga yi za gaskiyazhio.
Surah 59:9       ,                       But those who before them had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith- show their affection to such as came to them for refuge and entertain no desire in their hearts for things given to the (latter) but give them preference over themselves even though poverty was their (own lot). And those saved from the covetousness of their own souls- they are the ones that achieve prosperity.,Zananzhiy ma fedun zhi nbo nan (Madinao) aci shiadzo naa a'jin a fe wa za nanzhi gaa kpela be tsun'a nan a mae de dukata ke dan yangban'azhio yan yan nanzhi a ga la ya'a amaajin afe tsa yegiazhi ta eti atsozhio kaa'ga yi be bukata yan yan wuncin'y zandomdo nan ga tswiswa la'adan yanbotan yan yangban'u bo nanakika zawuncinzhi ga yi za nanzhia de rabo nao.
Surah 59:10      ,                And those who came after them say: "Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who came before us into the Faith and leave not in our hearts rancour (or sense of injury) against those who have believed. Our Lord! Thou art indeed Full of Kindness Most Merciful.",Za nan zhiy ma be zunma'abo nan e gan gan: Tsoci yi jin yi gafara to yegi yizhinan zhia shi yidzo be imaniy nan Wyo mao ga la nanvo ndondo dan yangban yi bo lo'eba za nanzhia imani jin nan ma Tsoci yi akika Wyo ga yi Etsu tosayio Wyo ga yi Etsu yegun'o.
Surah 59:11       ,                    Hast thou not observed the Hypocrites say to their misbelieving brethren among the People of the Book - "If ye are expelled we too will go out with you and we will never hearken to any one in your affair; and if ye are attacked (in fight) we will help you". But Allah is witness that they are indeed liars.,Wyo le za nanzhiy jin manafunci nan ye'a E gan be yegiazhi nanzhia jin kafirinci mini za ba Litafi zhio nan gan: Wallahi a ga ye nyan tin ya yi tso ga tin ya ganni be ye yin yi maa la mi tu foro yan zandondo eti ye bo san san yin'a. A ma ga gun ye kun ye kun yia jin'e taimako. Akika Soko jin'ri ke ganmanan zuncizhi a yio nan.
Surah 59:12    ,           If they are expelled never will they go out with them; and if they are attacked (in fight) they will never help them; and if they do help them they will turn their backs; so they will receive no help.,Ka a ga nya tin ya a dzun tinya bea yin'a ka ama ga gun'a kun a jin'a taimakoa ka ama ga jin'a taimako a ga zunma zheta fe bici gancin a ma'a jin'a taimakoa.
Surah 59:13  ,         Of a truth ye are stronger (than they) because of the terror in their hearts (sent) by Allah. This is because they are men devoid of understanding.,Akika dansun ye u gbota gan dansun Soko fi yangban'azhio wuncin mayi ebo nan a de kpikpe wangia nan.
Surah 59:14      ,                They will not fight you (even) together except in fortified townships or from behind walls. Strong is their fighting (spirit) amongst themselves: thou wouldst think they were united but their hearts are divided: that is because they are a people devoid of wisdom.,A gun ye kun wo baeni boa sai de ezhi nanzhiy a ga dan gba nao ko ma zunmashin yan karazhio.

Surah 59:15   ,       Like those who lately preceded them they have tasted the evil result of their conduct; and (in the Hereafter there is) for them a grievous Penalty;-,A yi ke Misali yan za nanzhiy Shidzo tsoba nan a'azaba yan etun dede'azhi fin azaba nan ma tan nan wun'a jin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 59:16     ,           (Their allies deceived them) like the Evil One when he says to man "Deny Allah": but when (man) denies Allah (the Evil One) says "I am free of thee: I do fear Allah the Lord of the Worlds!",Ke misali yan Sheitan nan kaminan uga gan zawangi gan: A jin kafirinci nan"kamina uga kafirincin jin zo nan u gan: Egwa mi de dan beo yin'a akika mie sundan Soko nae kpa alittazhi kpata nan.
Surah 59:17         The end of both will be that they will go into the Fire dwelling therein for ever. Such is the reward of the wrong-doers.Zoba'azhi za gubaaba cia fe enao ama' fi bo fi tutunyin wuncin ga ma yi egagba yan azwalumizhio.
Surah 59:18 ,               O ye who believe! Fear Allah and let every soul look to what (provision) He has sent forth for the morrow. Yea fear Allah: for Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan e sundan Soko zandondo ma'u cin'ule'u lo yan nan uga lashidzo ya etiu ya esun alkiyamio nan ye mae sundan Soko akika Soko yi be labariy yan etun nanzhi ye lo nan.
Surah 59:19    ,     And be ye not like those who forgot Allah; and He made them forget their own souls! Such are the rebellious transgressors!,Ye mae ga'a fe ke dozhin za nanzhia Soko batan na ma ebo nan Soko jin'atso a eti tacin'atso batan. Akika za wuncinzhi ga yi fasikizhio.
Surah 59:20   ,      Not equal are the Companions of the Fire and the Companions of the Garden: it is the Companions of the Garden that will achieve Felicity.,Egi mi na zhi a jin ye ni be egi mi aljanna yin'a egi mi aljannazhi aga yi za nanzhia de robo nao.
Surah 59:21       ,          Had We sent down this Qur´an on a mountain verily thou wouldst have seen it humble itself and cleave asunder for fear of Allah. Such are the similitudes which We propound to men that they may reflect.,Da' aci gan eti pati bo Yi cin Alkuranu nan nan tao da wyo a le pati wuncin nan nan tao da wyo a le pati wuncin ye ugaa daku uci gaa la'fi ebo dansun Soko misali wuncin ma Yie la'u la wu zawangizhi ebo ko a kpa ye.
Surah 59:22      ,      Allah is He than Whom there is no other god;- Who knows (all things) both secret and open; He Most Gracious Most Merciful.,Soko ga yi Etsu nan a de tsoci ndocia sai Wun nao. Etsu nan de kpikpe yan na'a swo nan to na'a tula nan u yio Etsu rahma Etsu yegun.
Surah 59:23  ,                Allah is He than Whom there is no other god;- the Sovereign the Holy One the Source of Peace (and Perfection) the Guardian of Faith the Preserver of Safety the Exalted in Might the Irresistible the Supreme: Glory to Allah! (High is He) above the partners they attribute to Him.,Soko ga yi Etsu nan a de tsoci ndocia sai Wun nao Etsu mulki Etsu lili Etsu aminci Etsu nae yedan yandondo nan Etsu zankpe Etsu Tiile Etsu cinwan.

Surah 59:24    ,            He is Allah the Creator the Evolver the Bestower of Forms (or Colours). To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names: whatever is in the heavens and on earth doth declare His Praises and Glory: and He is the Exalted in Might the Wise.,Wun ga yi Soko nae jin alitta nao Etsu nae tswa yan zhi nan Etsu nae la nankankpace ya alittazhi nan Etsu nan yi be sunna wangizhi nan.

﻿Surah 60:1                  ,                              O ye who believe! Take not my enemies and yours as friends (or protectors)- offering them (your) love even though they have rejected the Truth that has come to you and have (on the contrary) driven out the Prophet and yourselves (from your homes) (simply) because ye believe in Allah your Lord! If ye have come out to strive in My Way and to seek My Good Pleasure (take them not as friends) holding secret converse of love (and friendship) with them: for I know full well all that ye conceal and all that ye reveal.

(They prayed): "Our Lord! in Thee do we trust and to Thee do we turn in repentance: to Thee is (our) Final Goal.,Akika ye de yesan wangi dan mini (Annabi) Ibrahimao to jama'a nanzhi dan be'uyin nan nyan kaminan a gan be jamaa yan kinmi'azhi gan: Akika Yi yia egwa yizhi wa be ye yin to yannan ye jin bauta ya ke Soko lugwa nan Yi maa ga jin kafirinci be ye yin ewunsun be nanvoe ma'a tula tsakani yi bo be ye yin har abada sai de ye ga imani jin be Sokoe gbaugi sai de egan nan Ibrahima gan be Baba'u yin nan akika mia ba gafara ya wye mi ma de mulki yandondo ya wye wo wba Soko boa.

Surah 60:6           ,       There was indeed in them an excellent example for you to follow- for those whose hope is in Allah and in the Last Day. But if any turn away truly Allah is Free of all Wants Worthy of all Praise.,Akika ye de yesan wangi dan miniabo ammaa ya za nan gae jin kauna Soko be efo zobae nan.

Surah 60:7   ,           It may be that Allah will grant love (and friendship) between you and those whom ye (now) hold as enemies. For Allah has power (over all things); And Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Kengi uyio nan Soko ga cincin laadan tsakani yebo be za nanzhi ye nanvo miniabo nan Soko de kagbo eti wuncin'o.

Surah 60:8     ,               Allah forbids you not with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes from dealing kindly and justly with them: for Allah loveth those who are just.,Soko kan ye (adalinci'yn jin) be zananzhiy a gun ye kun mini adini boa naa yin'a ama ke nya yedzun emi yezhi boa e da gboro ye mae jin adalinci beayin akika Sokoe wa za nanzhi gae jin adalinci nan.
Surah 60:9  ,                  Allah only forbids you with regard to those who fight you for (your) Faith and drive you out of your homes and support (others) in driving you out from turning to them (for friendship and protection).

When there come to you believing women refugees examine (and test) them: Allah knows best as to their Faith: if ye ascertain that they are Believers then send them not back to the Unbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for the Unbelievers nor are the (Unbelievers) lawful (husbands) for them. But pay the Unbelievers what they have spent (on their dower) and there will be no blame on you if ye marry them on payment of their dower to them. But hold not to the guardianship of unbelieving women: ask for what ye have spent on their dowers and let the (Unbelievers) ask for what they have spent (on the dowers of women who come over to you). Such is the command of Allah: He judges (with justice) between you. And Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan kamina ynzagi Mumini nazhi ga'a kpe la be eba ye nan e ma'a cin le Soko ma de kpikpe yan imania gan U ga tula ya ye gan Muminazhi ayio e ga nyan'a kezhe da tsun kafirizhi be ma.

Surah 60:11             ,       And if any of your wives deserts you to the Unbelievers and ye have an accession (by the coming over of a woman from the other side) then pay to those whose wives have deserted the equivalent of what they had spent (on their dower). And fear Allah in Whom ye believe.,Yandoci ga bea fan'ye gwa mini yinmi yezhio lwo eba kafirizhi yeci gun'a kun har nyan'atsozhi ci dazhin eba ye za nanzhiy nyinmiazhi ga daa nan yea kwatonci yan yannanzhi a ga wu nan la' ya'a ye mae sundan Soko nan ye jin imani be yin nan.
Surah 60:12        ,                             O Prophet! When believing women come to thee to take the oath of fealty to thee that they will not associate in worship any other thing whatever with Allah that they will not steal that they will not commit adultery (or fornication) that they will not kill their children that they will not utter slander intentionally forging falsehood and that they will not disobey thee in any just matter- then do thou receive their fealty and pray to Allah for the forgiveness (of their sins): for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Yaw ye Annabi Mumina ynzagizhi ga be eba wye acia mubaya'a jin (a alkwaali yan imani jin) gan a'la yandondo pa Soko bacia a maayi yan'a a maa da yancin'a a ma wu egizhia a maa la egi yanci be ya ebaazhia a ma le foro wangi yan wyozhi baa wyo la mubaya'o jin bea yin (a yeda jin bea yin) wyo mao ba gafara yan Soko ya'a akika Soko' Etsu gafara u yio Etsu yegun u yio
Surah 60:13     ,             O ye who believe! Turn not (for friendship) to people on whom is the Wrath of Allah of the Hereafter they are already in despair just as the Unbelievers are in despair about those (buried) in graves.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan e ga la za nanzhi Soko'a zhewun be'ayin nan eya mancizhi ma akika zawuncinzhi'a kauna ba be egagba wangi yan efo zobae kendoe kafirizhi ba kauna be ekun nanzhi fi kabarizhio na.

Surah 61:3      ,  Grievously odious is it in the sight of Allah that ye say that which ye do not.,Wun'a gbota sarauyin eba Soko nan ye'a fe gan gan ye mae la lo tun'a nan.
Surah 61:4  ,        Truly Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in battle array as if they were a solid cemented structure.,Akika Soko e wa za nanzhie gunkun dan ekoubo aci yi safu nini nan ke wyoa ye gan batu ayio nanzhiy la gwa fin dozhin nan.
Surah 61:5 ,                     And remember Moses said to his people: "O my people! why do ye vex and insult me though ye know that I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you" Then when they went wrong Allah let their hearts go wrong. For Allah guides not those who are rebellious transgressors.,Kaminan (Annabi) Musa gan be jamaa yan'uzhi gan: Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi ki la yecie jin mi gun'o Akika yetso ma kpe gan Tuci Soko mi yi be eba ye yeo.

Surah 61:6     ,                         And remember Jesus the son of Mary said: "O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you confirming the Law (which came) before me and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me whose name shall be Ahmad." But when he came to them with Clear Signs they said "this is evident sorcery!",To kaminan (Annabi) Isa egi Maryama gan gan: Ya ye Bani Israilazhi akika Tuci mi yi be eba ye yeo na'a gaskiya ya be Litafi nanzhiy shidzo minI Attaurao nan Mi mae ya ye labari yan yangban fa be bibe yan Tuci ndoci zunma mibo nan suna'u yi Ahamadu nan.

Surah 61:8      ,    Their intention is to extinguish Allah´s Light (by blowing) with their mouths: But Allah will complete (the revelation of) His Light even though the Unbelievers may detest (it).,E wa gan a la aske Soko'a nu be misun'azhiy Soko ma ga askeu she ka kafirizhi ga nanvo nan.
Surah 61:9       ,      It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth that he may proclaim it over all religion even though the Pagans may detest (it).,Soko ga yi Etsu nan tun Tuci'utun be bawu'y ganni be adini yan gaskiya yin'o nan ebo u la wun'u la'utu ta eti adinizhio kpata ka da Mushrikizhi ga nanvo.

Surah 61:11  ,            That ye believe in Allah and His Messenger and that ye strive (your utmost) in the Cause of Allah with your property and your persons: That will be best for you if ye but knew!,Ya imani jin be Soko be Tuci'u yin ye mae fe jin jihadi (kokari wanciko) eti eko Soko be dukiya yezhi to nankan kpace zhiy wuncin ga yi alheri ya ye yeo ye ga kpe nan.

Surah 61:14   ,                               O ye who believe! Be ye helpers of Allah: As said Jesus the son of Mary to the Disciples "Who will be my helpers to (the work of) Allah" Said the disciples "We are Allah´s helpers!" then a portion of the Children of Israel believed and a portion disbelieved: But We gave power to those who believed against their enemies and they became the ones that prevailed.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan ye'a fe taimako jincizhi ya (adini) Soko iri kendoe (Annabi) Isa egi Maryama gan be Hawariyuzhiy'nan (za nan zhi tu'u zunma nan): Zi'a jin mi taimako eti etun Soko bo Hawariyuzhi cigan: Yi ga yi za nanzhia jin (adini) Soko taimako nao.

Surah 62:2      ,              It is He Who has sent amongst the Unlettered a messenger from among themselves to rehearse to them His Signs to sanctify them and to instruct them in Scripture and Wisdom- although they had been before in manifest error;-,Wyun ga yi za na tun Tuci fi Larabawazhi dagan mini atso nao.

Surah 62:5      ,                The similitude of those who were charged with the (obligations of the) Mosaic Law but who subsequently failed in those (obligations) is that of a donkey which carries huge tomes (but understands them not). Evil is the similitude of people who falsify the Signs of Allah: and Allah guides not people who do wrong.,Kotonci yan za nanzhi yi be kpikpe yan Attaura (litafi nan a cin be ya Annabi Musa) nan a ma lotun be yan nanzhi litafi gan naa nan a yi ke kotonci yan tyatyagi naa karazhi la nan (u de amfani ndondo boa sai wahala banza) bibi be -- sun'I wun'ajin tabbata ya za nanzhi'a aya Soko (zhi) yi ganmanan nan akika Soko'e la jamaa yan azwalumizhi ke eko guru'a.

Surah 63:4  ,                   When thou lookest at them their exteriors please thee; and when they speak thou listenest to their words. They are as (worthless as hollow) pieces of timber propped up (unable to stand on their own). They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies; so beware of them.

Surah 63:6     ,            It is equal to them whether thou pray for their forgiveness or not. Allah will not forgive them. Truly Allah guides not rebellious transgressors.,Daidai u yi etiabo ka wyo ga wa gafara ya ko ma wo'oga wa yaa ma Sokoa jin' gafara'a. Akika Soko wun'e la fasikizhi ke ekoa.
Surah 63:7    ,               They are the ones who say "Spend nothing on those who are with Allah´s Messenger to the end that they may disperse (and quit Medina)." But to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the Hypocrites understand not.,A (munafikizhi) ga yi za nanzhie gan gan: e ga la yangici ya za nanzhi dan eba Tuci Soko-onan ma har a la aga ya.

Surah 68:6, Which of you is afflicted with madness.,Zhi mini ye bo yi ilanduci be eza fitina yin'o
Surah 68:7   ,       Verily it is thy Lord that knoweth best which (among men) hath strayed from His Path: and He knoweth best those who receive (true) Guidance.,Akika Tsoci yan wyo'e u ga de kpikpe gan'o yan za nan zhi ga'ya ke eko gboro lu gwa nan-o Wun ga ma de kpikpe gan-o yan za nan zhi ta eti eko gboro eti shiri Soko nan-o.
Surah 68:8  ,So hearken not to those who deny (the Truth).,(Annabi) Ga jin yarda a mi. tu gan-ma-nan zun ci zhi ma.
Surah 68:9 ,  Their desire is that thou shouldst be pliant: so would they be pliant.,Kafirizhi e wa gan wo'ola o da o ci'o ya'a ebo etso a da'a ciaya Wo'e.
Surah 68:10   , Heed not the type of despicable men- ready with oaths,(Annabi) Ga jin yarda la mi tu zae ni ndondo nan ga gan kuti-zhi na ma. Wyo ma o ga la mi tu za banza zhi ma.
Surah 68:11, A slanderer going about with calumnies,Za nan zhie gan za wangi zhi yin'nan Za nan zhi e ku za wan gi zhi gun wun nan.

Surah 68:13   ,Violent (and cruel)- with all that base-born-,Eza eti kagbo ci zhi ba'aci siffa dede nan nan zhi'I u ke zhe yi egi nan'a ma yan cin'o nan.
Surah 68:14   , Because he possesses wealth and (numerous) sons.,Wun'a jin u fe pe ta eti kin bo ebo nan u yi ewo de ci nan u ma kezhe yi be egi zhi'I nan.
Surah 68:15   ,   When to him are rehearsed Our Signs "Tales of the ancients" he cries!,Ka ndondo nan a ga aya Mi zhi gba ya'u nan wun'a jin u gan: ecin zhi a yio yan za pa yin zhi.Surah 68:16  Soon shall We brand (the beast) on the snout!Yi ga alama dede la a ta u eti eye'u bo.

Surah 68:17    ,     Verily We have tried them as We tried the People of the Garden when they resolved to gather the fruits of the (garden) in the morning.,Akika Yi (Mi Soko) yi a maka-ci-zhi ma cin le (be azaba iri iri zhi) ken do'e Yi ma za ba lati ndoci zhi cin le nan.

Surah 68:19  ,    Then there came on the (garden) a visitation from thy Lord (which swept away) all around while they were asleep.,Azaba yan Soko ci'a lati'a zhi ma ke-zhe alhali ma a fi nbo e le le.Surah 68:20 So the (garden) became by the morning like a dark and desolate spot (whose fruit had been gathered).Lati a zhi cia shi zhiko kpiri'I ke ba zhiko yeshi nan.
Surah 68:21, As the morning broke they called out one to another-,A ci a do zhi san lokaci nan asuba wun'a jin nan. (ebo a da la yangici lati a ku talakazhi'a ga de rabo ndondo bo ma).
Surah 68:22   ,   "Go ye to your tilth (betimes) in the morning if ye would gather the fruits.",E' sa ka ye da e la yangici lati zhi e ku Niyan ye ga gbo-ka eti ku ku'u bo nan.
Surah 68:23 , So they departed conversing in secret low tones (saying)-,A ci a ezan la a ci fe gan gan be do-zhi eti shawar'ao swiswo ci.
Surah 68:24  ,   "Let not a single indigent person break in upon you into the (garden) this day.",(A fe' gan gan:) Yin nan e ga lu gwa talaka ko nini gan-dan lati o ma.

Surah 68:25 ,  And they opened the morning strong in an (unjust) resolve.,A ci a tin ya be kagbo yangban'e ke yan nan a zhi kuti gan a ya jin nan sai a ga'u jin.
Surah 68:26 ,   But when they saw the (garden) they said: "We have surely lost our way:,Lokaci nan' a tun lati nan a gan: Akika yi'a gbin ka.
Surah 68:27  "Indeed we are shut out (of the fruits of our labour)!"Sa-shi'a zhi gan: Yi gbin ka'a amma'a a yi kan amfani lati yin ku ebo niyan dede nan dan be yi yin nan'e.
Surah 68:28  ,    Said one of them more just (than the rest): "Did I not say to you ´Why not glorify (Allah)´",Nan tso de ankali gan mini'a bo nan gan: asha Mi gan ya ye ; gan: ye' sun dan Soko'a
Surah 68:29     They said: "Glory to our Lord! Verily we have been doing wrong!"Kpata ci gan: Lili be ela tui a jin tabbata ya Tsoci yan yi Akika yi a eti ta cin yi jin gun (ebo hakki yan talakazhi nan zhi yi la kan'a nan).
Surah 68:30   , Then they turned one against another in reproach.,A ci a eye zhe wu do zhi ci e jin do-zhi zargi.
Surah 68:31 ,   They said: "Alas for us! We have indeed transgressed!,A gan: ka sa re'! Akika yi a fe za' nan zhi a gbin iyaka Soko tu nan.
Surah 68:32   ,      "It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a better (garden) than this: for we do turn to Him (in repentance)!",U jin-y wa-wo Tsoci yan yi Wun'a la egba zhe ndoci yan alheri nan gan yan lati nna nan ya yi. Akika yi a fe za nan zhi e jin kawana alheri lo nko Tsoci yi nan.
Surah 68:33      , Such is the Punishment (in this life); but greater is the Punishment in the Hereafter- if only they knew!,Akika a cin ga ga azaba (Yi) yio ta eti azwalumi zhi bo tun da gan izhe ba bo)Akika ma azaba yan eku ba tso-zhi u gbo gan yan izhe amma' sai ye ga fe eza kpikpe zhi kanga ga ye a la hankali dan egan nan nan-o.

Surah 68:43  ,        Their eyes will be cast down- ignominy will cover them; seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration while they were whole (and had refused).,Eye' to fuska yan kafiri zhi to azwalumi zhi ga'a gba gba Zun ye sun ga'a wan gi Akika lokaci nan a ta eti rayi'o izhe o nan a fe yi'a gan a dakpe'a ya foro yan Soko (amma'a ebo yangici zheo be lafiya'e nan dan be a yin nan) a gan: a ya'a ta kpatsun -- foro Sokoa.
Surah 68:44      ,   Then leave Me alone with such as reject this Message: by degrees shall We punish them from directions they perceive not.,(Annabi) a Mi (Soko) ya be za ndondo nan ga e yi egan Misun Soko gan-manan nan Mi (Soko) a fe daagwa lo yegboro ba nan a kpe gan hallaka egba be zun ye sun'I wun'a be ya a nan.

Surah 68:46   ,   Or is it that thou dost ask them for a reward so that they are burdened with a load of debt-,Ka shii Annabi Wo'-e gbin'a gan la'ada yan etun nan Wo'e lo na gbin Ebo wun cin'o edu yan etun wo'zhi ci'a lu kpi fi'a

Surah 68:47 ,   Or that the Unseen is in their hands so that they can write it down,Ka shi'I a yi be kpi kpe yan gaibu'I yi Da gan kpikpe wun'cin'o a ci e ka (hukunci dedezhi ke ndo e ba'a nan
Surah 68:48    ,      So wait with patience for the Command of thy Lord and be not like the Companion of the Fish- when he cried out in agony.,Annabi a hankuri jin be kpikpe gi-ki-ni eti hukunci yan Tsoci o bo Ga nyin yangban ma Wo mao ga zhe wun do zhin yan (Annabi Yunusa) nan ikan la yin nan ma.
Surah 68:49     ,    Had not Grace from his Lord reached him he would indeed have been cast off on the naked shore in disgrace.,Ka u jin ebo ni'ima nan'a shi dzo ta eti u bo na'a' da a ga u ce-ya ci cikan'o (ba nan cigban ko fini u dan'a nan). U ci ga' fe za nan'a fe jin u zargi nan.

Surah 68:51    ,       And the Unbelievers would almost trip thee up with their eyes when they hear the Message; and they say: "Surely he is possessed!",Akika Kafiri zhi fe jin tanadi nan a ga wo jin hallaka be eye dede a zhi'I nan lokaci nan a wo tukpakpe nan wo la be na a ci a jin a fe' gan gan: Akika ilanduci tsa (Muhammadu) yio.

Surah 7:89   ,                                      "We should indeed invent a lie against Allah if we returned to your ways after Allah hath rescued us therefrom; nor could we by any manner of means return thereto unless it be as in the will and plan of Allah Our Lord.

Surah 7:94 ,           Whenever We sent a prophet to a town We took up its people in suffering and adversity in order that they might learn humility.,Yima la'atun Annabi ndoci lo alkarya ndoci lea sai de yi ga za kin wun cin (nazhia lebana) wan be aza'bae be bayibazhi to be egunzhi ujinwo be wuncin'y afe da kpya ya Soko.
Surah 7:95  ,               Then We changed their suffering into prosperity until they grew and multiplied and began to say: "Our fathers (too) were touched by suffering and affluence" ... Behold! We called them to account of a sudden while they realised not (their peril).,Gancin Yicie la gwasan la'adan eyandedeo be eyan wangi har ala-dokun acia gangan: "Hakika egun be azabae a yanmanci yizhi togwa.

Surah 7:96   ,              If the people of the towns had but believed and feared Allah We should indeed have opened out to them (All kinds of) blessings from heaven and earth; but they rejected (the truth) and We brought them to book for their misdeeds.,Hakika ma da acigan jama'a yan alkaryazhi ga imani jin jin aci tswa Soko be dan sun'u yin da'yi ga eko albarkazhi kpe ya'a dagan samao to kinbo amma'ade a (alamari Soko) yi ganmana ebo acin'o Yicia wan be iri etun nazhi afe cewo'u na.

Surah 7:100 ,                 To those who inherit the earth in succession to its (previous) possessors is it not a guiding (lesson) that if We so willed We could punish them (too) for their sins and seal up their hearts so that they could not hear,Kashi'ukun bawu ya zanazhe gi'gun yan kin baci yan jama'a nazhi ga -- gan na'a ke wun'a ba yi ba Yiga'a wan be zunubiazhi-na'a Yici ga eyan la'tea yangbanzhio aci ga'afe zanazhie wogan'a na'ayan'a

Thus doth Allah seal up the hearts of those who reject faith.,Alkarya wuncinzhi Yie ta ya wyoe dagan mini labariazhio hakika ma Tuciazhi be ya'a be hujja nazhi tula na to amafe zanazhia jin imani be yanan u'uyi ganmana shidzo batsozhio na'a.

Surah 7:116 ,         Said Moses: "Throw ye (first)." So when they threw they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them: for they showed a great (feat of) magic.,Ugan: ye fe ce. To kamina a ce yanzhi na a'eye zazhi jin sihiri acia li dansun aci be be sihiri na wancin nae.

Surah 7:131  ,                   But when good (times) came they said "This is due to us;" When gripped by calamity they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him!

The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they had patience and constancy and We levelled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected (with such pride).,Yicia Banu israila zhi la'azhe edu tu aci da gun be jama'a ndoci nazhia gi ba wun wun yan ku ti azhi na aci gan: Ya wyoe Musa!

Surah 7:142 ,                     We appointed for Moses thirty nights and completed (the period) with ten (more): thus was completed the term (of communion) with his Lord forty nights.

Allah said: "By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place then shalt thou see Me." When his Lord manifested His glory on the Mount He made it as dust. And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: "Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance and I am the first to believe.",Kamina Musa be mi'kati yi na Tsociu cigan be uyin Musa cigan: ya wyoe Tsoci mi!

Surah 7:155 ,                                       And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our place of meeting: when they were seized with violent quaking he prayed: "O my Lord! if it had been Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed long before both them and me: wouldst Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us this is no more than Thy trial: by it Thou causest whom Thou wilt to stray and Thou leadest whom Thou wilt into the right path. Thou art our Protector: so forgive us and give us Thy mercy; for Thou art the best of those who forgive.,Musa ci li za adwani bagizhi mini jama'a yan'uzhio nazhi lo miqati Yi na (bana Musae da -- wahayi na).

He said: "With My punishment I visit whom I will; but My mercy extendeth to all things. That (mercy) I shall ordain for those who do right and practise regular charity and those who believe in Our signs;,Wyo mao ka bolobolo'oya yi dan mini yizhe nanao to mini efo zobae (alkiyamio).

Surah 7:160,                                          We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: "Strike the rock with thy staff": out of it there gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds and sent down to them manna and quails (saying): "Eat of the good things We have provided for you": (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm but they harmed their own souls.,Yicia sa fi "sibti" (ezhimi ko kin) guwo be gubae alunmazhi.

Surah 7:161 ,                  And remember it was said to them: "Dwell in this town and eat therein as ye wish but say the word of humility and enter the gate in a posture of humility: We shall forgive you your faults; We shall increase (the portion of) those who do good.",To kamina agan ya gan: "Efedun dan alkarya nanao ye mae gi dagan miniubo bandondo na ga ba ye nao ye mae gan gan: (Soko) fa be yi yin ye mae gan'edan eko be sujadae: Yi afa be lefi'ezhi Yi ma'abe egagba alheri ya zannazhi gae jin bolo bolo na.Surah 7:162                But the transgressors among them changed the word from that which had been given them so we sent on them a plague from heaven. For that they repeatedly transgressed.Gancin zanazhia eti tacin'azhi jin zwalunci na cia egan sangwa ke na'agan ya' na lugwa Yici cin azaba be fia dagan sanmao ebo iri etun yan zwalunci nazhi afe lo na.
Surah 7:163  ,                        Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them openly holding up their heads but on the day they had no Sabbath they came not: thus did We make a trial of them for they were given to transgression.,Wyo mao gbin'agan labari alkarya wuncin na ci kpata misun'ona kamina afe -- iyaka gan eti (hukunci) efo Asibio na (Sokoa ikan wan la'azhe haramu ya'a asibi foe) kanga ma ikan'azhi ciaajin afe tin ya gu ra rae.

Surah 7:164,                  When some of them said: "Why do ye preach to a people whom Allah will destroy or visit with a terrible punishment"- said the preachers:" To discharge our duty to your Lord and perchance they may fear Him.",To kamina jama'a ndocizhi miniabo gan: Ebo ki'ibo ye cie jin jama'a nazhi Soko ajin hallaka na ko ma wyun'a jin a azaba tsuntsunnu na wa'azio Acigan: yie jin jin ebo ulau fe uzuri-u ya yi lo eba tsoci ye uma jinwo be wuncin'y agaa fe za nazhie sundan sokona.
Surah 7:165,                 When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them We rescued those who forbade Evil; but We visited the wrong-doers with a grievous punishment because they were given to transgression.,Kamina abea tanba la'alo yan nazhi asan'atu be yin na Yia za na zhie na-wun cie kan etun dede na gangwa Yicia zanazhia eti taacin'azhi jin zwalunci na wan be azaba bibiciy" ebo etun fasikanci nazhi afe lo na.

Surah 7:167      ,            Behold! thy Lord did declare that He would send against them to the Day of Judgment those who would afflict them with grievous penalty. Thy Lord is quick in retribution but He is also Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,To kamina Tsoci wyoe ya'mi na akika wyun'a tun zadedezhi fia har da efo Alkiyami nazhia fe ya azaba dedezhi fin na hakika Tsoci wyoe Etsu nae din ye be jin jin azabae na uyio hakika ma wyin'y (Soko) Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 7:168   ,          We broke them up into sections on this earth. There are among them some that are the righteous and some that are the opposite. We have tried them with both prosperity and adversity: In order that they might turn (to us).,Yicia sa fi kinbo (aciafe) jama'a kpere kperezhi miniabo ade zaguruzhi fibo mini abo ma ade nazhi jin za guru zhia na. Yima ma'acinle be eyan wangi zhi to be eyan dedezhi ko be wuncin-y a zheban eti ekpya dao lo eba Soko.
Surah 7:169   ,                                    After them succeeded an (evil) generation: They inherited the Book but they chose (for themselves) the vanities of this world saying (for excuse): "(Everything) will be forgiven us." (Even so) if similar vanities came their way they would (again) seize them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth and they study what is in the Book. But best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter. Will ye not understand,Gancin za zun mazhi ci be gwo gwa zunma yan zanazhia shi dzo nao acia litafi gigun (kpikpeu) acie da gwo eyan zwizwoci yan izhe gbi gba ci na na (kini giba yan bawu Soko) acie gan gan: bele yin afa be yi yin.

Surah 7:170 ,        As to those who hold fast by the Book and establish regular prayer- never shall We suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.,Zanazhi mae la gwa sun litafi na aci kezhea sallah ku gikini na hakika Yi yie ta ega gba yan zaguruzhi ya kpea.
Surah 7:171       ,           When We shook the Mount over them as if it had been a canopy and they thought it was going to fall on them (We said): "Hold firmly to what We have given you and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein; perchance ye may fear Allah.",To kamina Yi la pati tu ta eti'abo na wyo cia ye gan ko girgije uyio aci fe kpaye ke de hakika uga'a kpankpea na (aci gan 'agan): yea egwa sun yan na Yi la ya ye na be kagboe ye mae fepa yan na zhi fi bo na ujin wo be wuncin'y ye ga fe za na zhie tswa Soko acie sun dan'una.
Surah 7:172  ,                       When thy Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify concerning themselves (saying): "Am I not your Lord (who cherishes and sustains you)"- They said: "Yea! We do testify!" (This) lest ye should say on the Day of Judgment: "Of this we were never mindful":,(Wyo mao pa) lokaci na Tsoci wyoe la alkawali be egi yan Adama zhi-na dagan mini dzo dzoa zhio zuriya'azhi dan bo ucia atso la'afe eri jincizhi ta eti tacin'atso zhio (uci gan) Asa ujin Migayi Tsoci ye yea Acigan: "E'ba acinga gao yima' eri jin" (aci gan) Ebo Efo Alkiyamio ye be gan gan: Akika yi yia ya ye ke (alkawali) na na lugwa ma.

Surah 7:174  ,  Thus do We explain the signs in detail; and perchance they may turn (unto Us).,Acinga ga ma Yi yia jin yi kpe aya zhi yeo (be bayani zhi yin'o): ujinwo be wuncin'y zawangizhia zheban da tsun Soko be ekpyadae.
Surah 7:175  ,          Relate to them the story of the man to whom We sent Our signs but he passed them by: so Satan followed him up and he went astray.,Wyo mao gba labario ya'a yan za na yi la aya Yi zhi be ya na ucia mini'u wa ya dagan minia bo na gan cin shetan ci fe gba'uza ucia fe dan mini zanazhia jin hallaka nao.
Surah 7:176    ,                         If it had been Our will We should have elevated him with Our signs; but he inclined to the earth and followed his own vain desires. His similitude is that of a dog: if you attack him he lolls out his tongue or if you leave him alone he (still) lolls out his tongue. That is the similitude of those who reject Our signs; So relate the story; perchance they may reflect.,Uma ga ba Yi ba da Yi gau la'atu be aya wuncin zhi amma de wyun tso egba wa dan kin bo ucia emi tu etun yan gban'u koton ci yan za wuncin wun'afe ke koton ci eshigi na wyo ga wa'u wun ufe ce gin tara ka wyo ma gau ya yan'u wun'afe ce gintara na na ga yi koton ci yan jama'a nazhia aya Soko zhi yi gan ma nao: gba etan (labari) na na ya'a ujin wo be wuncin'y aga fe za na zhiekpa ye na.
Surah 7:177 ,       Evil as an example are people who reject Our signs and wrong their own souls.,Bibi wun'ajin tabatta ya koton ci yan jama'a nazhia aya Yizhi yi ganmana na eti tacin'atso tsa ma ejin zwaluncio.Surah 7:178         Whom Allah doth guide- he is on the right path: whom He rejects from His guidance- such are the persons who perish.Zandondo na Soko ga'a la ke eko na wyun ga ke eko za na ma ugau gbin na To zawun cin zhi ga yi eza hassara zhio.
Surah 7:179   ,                          Many are the Jinns and men we have made for Hell: They have hearts wherewith they understand not eyes wherewith they see not and ears wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle- nay more misguided: for they are heedless (of warning).,Hakika ma yi jin alittazhi ebo jahannamao nazhi dokun na mini aljanizhio to zawan gi zhio ayi be yan gban zhi egan zhi mae yea ama yi be eye zhiamae la'a le ba yea ama yi be tukpa zhi amae la'a wo gan'a: zawuncin zhi ke dabba zhi na ayio.

Surah 7:180        ,     The most beautiful names belong to Allah: so call on him by them; but shun such men as use profanity in his names: for what they do they will soon be requited.,Soko ma yi be sunna wan gi zhi ebo acin'o efebau yan be a yin ye mae dzun gan zana zhie nyin sunna Soko zhi ya nao: Be le yin aga'agba be iri etun nazhie lo na.
Surah 7:181   ,   Of those We have created are people who direct (others) with truth. And dispense justice therewith.,A ma de dan mini alitta nazhi Yi jin na jama'azhi ayio e-wu zazhi ba be gaskiyae be uyin ma gae jin adalincio.
Surah 7:182 ,      Those who reject Our signs We shall gradually visit with punishment in ways they perceive not;,Zanazhi ma aya Yi zhi yi gan mana na Yia dzua lo edzun ba ndoci yi cia dzun fia dagan ba na ade kpi kpe wun'a na.
Surah 7:183,    Respite will I grant unto them: for My scheme is strong (and unfailing).,Mimae pata pa ya'a hakika tangi tso yan Mi ugbo ka sarau yin .
Surah 7:184    ,      Do they not reflect Their companion is not seized with madness: he is but a perspicuous warner.,Kashi akpa ye kpa'a ngan batan yan iladzun udan be maso yia yin'a hakika ufea sai de gan gba jin ci na;a tu la na.
Surah 7:185,                     Do they see nothing in the government of the heavens and the earth and all that Allah hath created (Do they not see) that it may well be that their terms is nigh drawing to an end In what message after this will they then believe,Kashi acin le lo eba mulki yan sanmazhi to kin yin'a to iri yandondo na Soko jin jin na'a uma jin wo gan ajali azhie la'a tso ba ni  To egan ki ci baci wuncin'o ke na yea jin imani be yin nao

Surah 7:187,                                    They ask thee about the (final) Hour - when will be its appointed time Say: "The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (alone): None but He can reveal as to when it will occur. Heavy were its burden through the heavens and the earth. Only all of a sudden will it come to you." They ask thee as if thou Wert eager in search thereof: Say: "The knowledge thereof is with Allah (alone) but most men know not.",Egbin wyo gan eti eka yan ekin na kiyamao foci wun'ajin tabbattao Gan gan: hakika de kpi kpeu dan be tso ci mi yin.

Surah 7:189  ,                          It is He Who created you from a single person and made his mate of like nature in order that he might dwell with her (in love). When they are united she bears a light burden and carries it about (unnoticed). When she grows heavy they both pray to Allah their Lord (saying): "If Thou givest us a goodly child we vow we shall (ever) be grateful.",Wyun ga yi Etsu na jin alitta ye dagan rayi ninio na Ucia yiwo jin yau dagan minia tso ebo ude bau fa yangban'u dan miniubo.

Surah 79:12  ,  They say: "It would in that case be a return with loss!",Acigan: u dema'ayi acin'o kundondo zazhi ga'ajin asara.
Surah 79:13,   But verily it will be but a single (Compelling) Cry,Akika al'amari' nyan ekin-na efo kiyama ewuti nin kete un'ga'a kunke'o.
Surah 79:14,  When behold they will be in the (full) awakening (to Judgment).,Eda-na agae be'una alittazhi kpa'ata ga'gunyekan zhi fili ega-gba'o.
Surah 79:15,   Has the story of Moses reached thee,Ya'a wye Annabi ngba labari yan (Annabi) Musa be-ebawo ya' nin
Surah 79:16 ,    Behold thy Lord did call to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa:-,Nyan kakun-na Tsociu yin pati nayi lilici naeyigan tuwa-nao.
Surah 79:17,    "Go thou to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds:,Soko cigan ya'u gan; u naukin u'loeba fir'auna ebona fir'auna a gbin nugun nyan Soko tu.
Surah 79:18 ,    "And say to him ´Wouldst thou that thou shouldst be purified (from sin),-Wyo gan-oyan'u gan: Wun- awa lili ya eti tacin-wyun'a
Surah 79:19,   "´And that I guide thee to thy Lord so thou shouldst fear Him´",Ebo wyo gaewa min' la eko nyan Tsocin wuwye wolaofezanae sundan Soko nan.
Surah 79:20 , Then did (Moses) show him the Great Sign.(Annabi Musa) Cila a'ya nawancin-na wu fir'auna.
Surah 79:21 But (Pharaoh) rejected it and disobeyed (guidance);,Amma' Fir'auna a'aya Soko yi ganmanan u ci fe le sokoba loyegboro.
Surah 79:22,  Further he turned his back striving hard (against Allah).,Ucia Zummazhe cie jin yanna bauna.
Surah 79:23 ,Then he collected (his men) and made a proclamation,U cia jama'a zhi kuyekan Zhizhi uci ya mi yaa.
Surah 79:24   ,Saying "I am your Lord Most High".,Uci fe-gan gan: mi (Fir'auna) gayi tsoci ye natso latu gan nan-o.
Surah 79:25  ,  But Allah did punish him (and made an) example of him - in the Hereafter as in this life.,Soko ciu wan ebo lefi natso-u jin zunma-o na to yan mafari na-ujin nan.
Surah 79:26  ,   Verily in this is an instructive warning for whosoever feareth (Allah).,Akikawuncin-na'ajin be fir'auna nan uga afe gan-gba ya zanazhi gae-sudan Soko nan.
Surah 79:27  ,   What! Are ye the more difficult to create or the heaven (above) (Allah) hath constructed it:,Yegayi alita natso gboka gan-nao Kashi sanma (Gutwaba) nayi tu gikin-ni bekagbo e'nan
Surah 79:28 , On high hath He raised its canopy and He hath given it order and perfection.,Soko cia sama latu uci kezhi'u jin daidai.
Surah 79:29 ,  Its night doth He endow with darkness and its splendour doth He bring out (with light).,Soko cia Yeshiu laa shi Zhiko ucia yigidi'u la'ana-behaske.
Surah 79:30,   And the earth moreover hath He extended (to a wide expanse);,Ba'aci wuncin'o ucia ta cici pa'arae.
Surah 79:31 ,  He draweth out therefrom its moisture and its pasture;,Ucia nuwan la'dzunzhin dagan mini-u-bo gangani be yangici nyan dabbazhi.
Surah 79:32 ,And the mountains hath He firmly fixed;-,Soko ma kezhea patizhi kan gikinbo be kagboe.
Surah 79:33,  For use and convenience to you and your cattle.,(Kpata (Yannazhi) ebo alaafe eyan emawoa yayezawangizhi to dabba yezhi.
Surah 79:34,   Therefore when there comes the great overwhelming (Event)-,(Amma'de) Efona ebazhe wanciko nyan kiyama gabe dabe nan.
Surah 79:35 ,   The Day when man shall remember (all) that he strove for,Efo wuncin Zawangi-ndondo wun apa iri etun nazhi u lo izhe-o-nana.
Surah 79:36  , And Hell-Fire shall be placed in full view for (all) to see-,Aciga ena nyan jahimi la'akefili yazanazhi ga-- yin a liuye nan.
Surah 79:37  ,Then for such as had transgressed all bounds,Akika Zandondo naga'afe zanaegbin iyaka Soko tunan.
Surah 79:38,  And had preferred the life of this world,Uci Kezhiea' cincin nyan-izhe la'agboka dan yangban'ubo a gan yan alkiyami na.
Surah 79:39,   The Abode will be Hell-Fire;,Akika ena nyan jahimu ga'ayi' ezhe-keba-wun-o.
Surah 79:40     ,   And for such as had entertained the fear of standing before their Lord´s (tribunal) and had restrained (their) soul from lower desires,Amma'de Zandondo naga'afe zanae'sundan kinigi yegboro yan Tsoci-u- bonan ucia eyan sha'hawa yizhe la'akan yangban'u na.
Surah 79:41,   Their abode will be the Garden.,Akika Aljanna-ga'ayi ezhe keba wun-o.
Surah 79:42  ,  They ask thee about the Hour-´When will be its appointed time,(Kafirizhi) A'ajin afe gbinwyogan-gan:Fociotsa a'jin Kiyama-o
Surah 79:43,   Wherein art thou (concerned) with the declaration thereof,Kinigiba kici wyoga' 'akpe akika yan efo kiyama yeo
Surah 79:44 , With thy Lord in the Limit fixed therefor.,Kpikpe yan alamari Kiyama Kpata dan-be Sokoe.
Surah 79:45,    Thou art but a Warner for such as fear it.,Etun yan-wyo-de wyojin ganga'oya zanazhi gae sundan efo kiyama-nan.
Surah 79:46  ,      The Day they see it (It will be) as if they had tarried but a single evening or (at most till) the following morn!,Fondondo nan aga efo kiyama leyena zandondo-afe leye ke edunfe wyin kabario uyi daidai be lokaci yeshi nini-nan ko ke lokaci yan wallae na.
﻿Surah 8:1   ,               They ask thee concerning (things taken as) spoils of war. Say: "(such) spoils are at the disposal of Allah and the Messenger: So fear Allah and keep straight the relations between yourselves: Obey Allah and His Messenger if ye do believe.",E'gbin wyogan eti hukunci yan Gani'imao Gangan:- Gani'ima (naagade kunda yanmusuluncio na) yan Soko uyio Toci ebo acin'o esundan Soko ye mae fe jin gyara tsakani ebo be dozhi yemae fe gba Soko to Tuciu wun'ayi muminizhiye yiona.
Surah 8:2      ,          For Believers are those who when Allah is mentioned feel a tremor in their hearts and when they hear His signs rehearsed find their faith strengthened and put (all) their trust in their Lord;,Hakika de zanazhie ye muminizhia agayi zanazhi kandondo na aga sunna Soko tunye yangban'azhie la'she be dansun (Sokoe) nao ama ga aya Soko zhigba ya'a wun'ajin ubea imani jin (be Sokoe) Tsociama wyun gae yakpe dan hali ndondo bo.
Surah 8:2 ,               For Believers are those who when Allah is mentioned feel a tremor in their hearts and when they hear His signs rehearsed find their faith strengthened and put (all) their trust in their Lord;,Hakika de zanazhie ye muminizhia agayi zanazhi kandondo na aga sunna Soko tunye yangban'azhie la'she be dansun (Sokoe) nao ama ga aya Soko zhigba ya'a wun'ajin ubea imani jin (be Sokoe) Tsociama wyun gae yakpe dan hali ndondo bo.
Surah 8:3 ,    Who establish regular prayers and spend (freely) out of the gifts We have given them for sustenance:,Zanazhie ku sallah gikini na ama'ajin afe wu dukiya'azhi mini arziki nazhi Yi la ya'a na (fi eko Soko'o).
Surah 8:4   ,       Such in truth are the believers: they have grades of dignity with their Lord and forgiveness and generous sustenance:,Za wuncinzhi agayi muminizhi yan gaskiyao. Ayi be daraja kozhi dan eba Tsociabo to gafara (na Wyun'ajin'ana) to arziki na wancin na.
Surah 8:4    ,      Such in truth are the believers: they have grades of dignity with their Lord and forgiveness and generous sustenance:,Za wuncinzhi agayi muminizhi yan gaskiyao. Ayi be daraja kozhi dan eba Tsociabo to gafara (na Wyun'ajin'ana) to arziki na wancin na.
Surah 8:5    ,      Just as thy Lord ordered thee out of thy house in truth even though a party among the Believers disliked it,Kendoe Tsoci wyoe la wyo tinya dagan emi wyobo be gaskiyae na hakika Sashi Mini muminizhio ajin afe navo.(na'atinya nbo ebo Soko'o na.
Surah 8:6    ,      Disputing with thee concerning the truth after it was made manifest as if they were being driven to death and they (actually) saw it.,Acia jin afe gbomi bewyoyin dan mini alamari gaskiya'a latu'ani na (acie jin bojin) ke wyoa gangan e'da'agwa da lo eba ajali na ala'alima amae'leu ye.
Surah 8:7 ,                     Behold! Allah promised you one of the two (enemy) parties that it should be yours: Ye wished that the one unarmed should be yours but Allah willed to justify the Truth according to His words and to cut off the roots of the Unbelievers;-,To kamina Soko jin ye alkawali yan nasara ta etijama'a ninio mini jama'a gubabao nao kede Wyunga ye la'ata'atio na ye cie kpaye gan jam'a nazhi de eyan kun'ana aga Sokoa la yaye yeo na Soko ma'akpa shizo gan wyunga gaskiyala'ajin tabbata be hukunci uyin Umau la edzo yan kafirizhiu dzau ya.
Surah 8:8,      That He might justify Truth and prove Falsehood false distasteful though it be to those in guilt.,Ebo ula gaskiya'u la'ujin tabbata Umaula ganmana'u nyin'u ya kadalefi jincizhi ga navo na.
Surah 8:9  ,        Remember ye implored the assistance of your Lord and He answered you: "I will assist you with a thousand of the angels ranks on ranks.",(Ye'pa) Kamina ye fe ba taimako dagan eba Tsoci yebo na Umacia aduwa ye gwo kede :- hakika mia jin ye taimako be malaika kpu'utsun'y nazhia lami latu dozhi na.
Surah 8:10      ,           Allah made it but a message of hope and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from Allah: and Allah is Exalted in Power Wise.,Soko ma la wuncin la fea saide yangbanfa alheri ebo ma to yangban yezhi ala'ashi tsu'uyin beu yin ye mae kpe'ewo kede nasara udan be zando yin'a sai be Sokoe na : Hakika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio.Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 8:11  ,                   Remember He covered you with a sort of drowsiness to give you calm as from Himself and he caused rain to descend on you from heaven to clean you therewith to remove from you the stain of Satan to strengthen your hearts and to plant your feet firmly therewith.,(Epa) Kamina Soko la yi-gbe ta cia la'akpe ye na Ucia fe aminci yaye dagan eba ubo Uci fe du ele be yaye dagan sanmao ebo ula ye yeu li beu yin Uma'ula shikan yan shetan yan'u kpe'u ya be yin ebo ma ula yan gban yezhiu wan'u pa be kagbo imani uma'u la bici kinpa yezhiu g okau ta eti kinbo.
Surah 8:12    ,                  Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instil terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them.",Kamina Tsoci wyoe fe jin wahayi fi Malaikazhi na kede ;Hakika mi dan be ye yin ebo acin'o egbo yangban yan muminizhi ka be imani bele yin yin Miga edo be dansun'i ce dan yangban yan za nazhia jin kafirinci nao ebo aci'n'o ewua eti koroazhio ye mae wua vundunugiazhio.
Surah 8:13 ,           This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger: If any contend against Allah and His Messenger Allah is strict in punishment.,Wuncin mayi ebo na a le Soko be Tuciu yin ba nao. Zan dondo na ma gae le Soko be Tuciu yin ba na to hakika Soko gbota eba azaba jin'o.
Surah 8:14,     Thus (will it be said): "Taste ye then of the (punishment): for those who resist Allah is the penalty of the Fire.",Wuncin zhi ga dan'o nao efe fin azaba Soko hakika ma azaba yan ena uga'ajin tabbata ya kafirizhi.
Surah 8:15 ,         O ye who believe! when ye meet the Unbelievers in hostile array never turn your backs to them.,Ya yenazhia imani jin na! kandondo na ye ga'gun be kafirizhi ekundao na to ega kara zhe zunmayezhi ya'a ma.
Surah 8:16  ,                 If any do turn his back to them on such a day - unless it be in a stratagem of war or to retreat to a troop (of his own)- he draws on himself the wrath of Allah and his abode is Hell- an evil refuge (indeed)!,Zandondo na ga zunmauzhe cie bici efo iri wuncin'ina sai de wyo gae wa gan wyoa ye enasa ya ekungun na koma wyoa zheban da tsun ekun gunci nayncin wyozhi na (ka gan ujin be uzuri yin'a) to zawuncin'a zheban zhe be ewunzhe dagan eba Soko ezhekebau mayi ena jahanna ma bibi ma'jin tabbata ya zoba wuncin.
Surah 8:17  ,                  It is not ye who slew them; it was Allah: when thou threwest (a handful of dust) it was not thy act but Allah´s: in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself: for Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).,Uma jin ye wu a amma'de Soko wu'ao:umaji wyo ce yan ke'a kamina wyo ce yan na'a. Amma'de Soko ce yan'o :Ebo ma Wyun'uma Muminizhiu cin'ule be mima cin le wangi'I dagan eba ubo.Hakika Soko Etsu nae wo na uyioEtsu kpikpe uyio.Surah 8:18     That and also because Allah is He Who makes feeble the plans and stratagem of the Unbelievers.Wuncinzhi ga dan'o nao hakika ma Soko ga tanadi yan kafirizhi to gbogun.
Surah 8:19  ,                     (O Unbelievers!) if ye prayed for victory and judgment now hath the judgment come to you: if ye desist (from wrong) it will be best for you: if ye return (to the attack) so shall We. Not the least good will your forces be to you even if they were multiplied: for verily Allah is with those who believe!,Wun'ayi gan nassara ye'e wao to nassara dabe yaye yeani ye ma ga etun dede lugwa to wuncin gayi alheri ya yeo ye ma ga ke dazhin (eti ewun sun'o)yi tso ma'ake dazhin (be azabze) jama'a nazhi ma ye aga dokun gan'acin. Hakika ma Soko dan be Muminizhi.
Surah 8:20  ,        O ye who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger and turn not away from him when ye hear (him speak).Ya ye nazhia imani jin na ye'a gba Soko to Tuci'u ye mae ga zhe zunma ta alamari Soko ma alaali ma ye tsoe wo (na wyun'e yie na).
Surah 8:21 ,      Nor be like those who say "We hear" but listen not:,Ye mae ga'a fe iri yan zanazhi gangan:"yi wo" ala'alima e'woa na ma.
Surah 8:22 ,        For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf and the dumb- those who understand not.,Hakika dabba na biyegan mini dabbazhi eba Soko'o na agayi zanazhia te tukpa (e'wogan Soko'a) acie zhe edingizhi ama'afe zanazhie lo'tun be hankalia yin'a na.
Surah 8:23  ,        If Allah had found in them any good. He would indeed have made them listen: (As it is) if He had made them listen they would but have turned back and declined (Faith).,Soko ga tsun alheri tsun fi bea yin da wyun'a ya'a iko yan wiwo (ama jin eza alheri zhia) ka'Uga yaa iiko wiwo hakika aga zunmazheta (gaskiya) aci ga keu lugwa.
Surah 8:24    ,               O ye who believe! give your response to Allah and His Messenger when He calleth you to that which will give you life; and know that Allah cometh in between a man and his heart and that it is He to Whom ye shall (all) be gathered.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Efe ye yiyi Soko be yan Tuciy kandondo na uga yie lo eba yan na'a be rayi be rayuwa wangi na:Ye mae kpe wo kede Soko wyun'ajin'ulo dan tsakani zawangi be yan nazhigae sa fi yangban'una (be ajali'i) hakika ma Etsu uyio na ga ye kpata kuyekan zhiyegboro'ubo na.
Surah 8:25,            And fear tumult or oppression which affecteth not in particular (only) those of you who do wrong: and know that Allah is strict in punishment.,Ye mae tswa fitina na masiibau wun'a kan eti azwalumi nazhi din'u be kawan yin'a na ye mae kpee wo kede hakika Soko Etsu na gbota eba jinjin azaba bona uyio.
Surah 8:26    ,              Call to mind when ye were a small (band) despised through the land and afraid that men might despoil and kidnap you; But He provided a safe asylum for you strengthened you with His aid and gave you Good things for sustenance: that ye might be grateful.,Ye mae pa lokacina yea fe ezadegi nama'afe eza gbogunnzhi fi kinbo na ye ci fe sundan na zandoncizhia bea ye fe la na Soko cia ye ya ecinba (yan yangbanshi madinao) Ucia ye ya kagbo be nasara uyin uci kezhea ye ya arziki dagan mini yangici wangizhio ebo ujinwo be wuncinzhi ye ga'afe za nazhie jin yebo ya Soko na.
Surah 8:27 ,         O ye that believe! betray not the trust of Allah and the Messenger nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to you.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! E ga fe ta Soko to Tuciu be jinjin hainci'ima ye tso mae ga jin dozhi hainci'fe gi amana dozhi ma  ala'ali ma yetso kpewo ke ugyea na.
Surah 8:28   ,      And know ye that your possessions and your progeny are but a trial; and that it is Allah with Whom lies your highest reward.,Ye mae kpe kede hakika dukiya yezhi to egi yezhi fitina ayio na hakika ma (zana ga tswa Soko danbo na) egagba na wancin na ga'ajin tabatta yau dan eba Soko.
Surah 8:29  ,               O ye who believe! if ye fear Allah He will grant you a criterion (to judge between right and wrong) remove from you (all) evil (that may afflict) you and forgive you: for Allah is the Lord of grace unbounded.Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! ,Ye ga'afe za nazhie tswa Soko cie sundan una uga etsazhi be erikpe wangizhi la'aya ye uma ga etun dede yezhi kpata paya ya ye uma'afe be yin Soko ma Etsu falala uyio na wancin na.
Surah 8:30   ,            Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee to keep thee in bonds or slay thee or get thee out (of thy home). They plot and plan and Allah too plans; but the best of planners is Allah.,Wyo mao pa lokaci na zanazhia jin kafirinci na fe pa makirinci eti wyobo na ebo ala wyo'a kan'adan koma ala wyo ya'a wu koma ala wyo ya'a nyan adzun ezhio na.

Surah 8:30 ,              Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee to keep thee in bonds or slay thee or get thee out (of thy home). They plot and plan and Allah too plans; but the best of planners is Allah.,Wyo mao pa lokaci na zanazhia jin kafirinci na fe pa makirinci eti wyobo na ebo ala wyo'a kan'adan koma ala wyo ya'a wu koma ala wyo ya'a nyan adzun ezhio na.

Surah 8:31,                When Our Signs are rehearsed to them they say: "We have heard this (before): if we wished we could say (words) like these: these are nothing but tales of the ancients."Ama ga gba aya Yizhi yaa ajin agangan: ",Hakika yiwo nana (leani) uga bayi tso da yitso agan iri nana ma nana de  ufea saide ecin yan zamafarizhi.
Surah 8:32   ,               Remember how they said: "O Allah if this is indeed the Truth from Thee rain down on us a shower of stones form the sky or send us a grievous penalty.",To kamina agan gan: ya wyoe Soko! Wun'ayi gan alamari nana wyun gayi gaskiya na fe be dagan eba wyobo nao to dule yan takun azaba be kpeyi dagan sanmao koma wyo'obe'o yayi be azaba ndoci na tan na.
Surah 8:33         ,  But Allah was not going to send them a penalty whilst thou wast amongst them; nor was He going to send it whilst they could ask for pardon.,Soko mafe Etsu na ajin'a azaba na'a al'alima wyo yidan ta'acin'abo na'a Soko mafe Etsu na'ajin'a azaba na'a ala'lima afe zanazhie ba gafara na'a.
Surah 8:34 ,                   But what plea have they that Allah should not punish them when they keep out (men) from the sacred Mosque - and they are not its guardians No men can be its guardians except the righteous; but most of them do not understand.,Ki'ma dan bea yin'o na'ala Soko cia jin'azaba na'a yin'o ala'alima ekan zawangizhi ke masalaci Harami lugwa nao Uma jin atsawun hak yan tswi tswa wun'a. Hakika zanazhi wun hakika yan tswi tswa'una aga yi zanazhi gae tswa Soko acie sundan'Unao. Amma'de ekun dondo azhi ade kpikpea.
Surah 8:35,            Their prayer at the House (of Allah) is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands: (Its only answer can be) "Taste ye the penalty because ye blasphemed.",Salla'azhi ma eba kata (ka'abao) ufea sai de iko-be be egwa-koe: eboacin'o efe fin azaba ebo iri etun kafirinci nazhi ye fe lo na.
Surah 8:36   ,                 The Unbelievers spend their wealth to hinder (man) from the path of Allah and so will they continue to spend; but in the end they will have (only) regrets and sighs; at length they will be overcome: and the Unbelievers will be gathered together to Hell;-,Hakika zanazhia jin kafirinci be Sokoe na ajin afe wu dukiya azhi ebo adeba'akan zawangi zhi ezan ta eti ekpa Soko: to aga dukiya'zhi wugagancin uci ga'afe ro-- n kpe yaa gancin be aciga'a zankpe zanazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na a kuaku yekan lo ena jahanama.
Surah 8:37  ,               In order that Allah may separate the impure from the pure put the impure one on another heap them together and cast them into Hell. They will be the ones to have lost.,Ebo Soko debau la eyan dedezhiu tsa'u ya dagan mini eyan wangi zhio Uciu la eyan dedezhiu ku'ukpe eti sashio uci ga'u la'afe dan mini ena jahanamao. Zawun ci zhi aga yi eza hassarazhio
Surah 8:38      ,         Say to the Unbelievers if (now) they desist (from Unbelief) their past would be forgiven them; but if they persist the punishment of those before them is already (a matter of warning for them).,Gan ya zanazhia jin kafirinci na aga gwa kpe eti yan na Sokoa kan na aafa beayin yan yannazhi ajin shidzo na hakika ekpa hallaka yan za mafari zhi wun'a shidzoa ni.
Surah 8:39    ,           And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere; but if they cease verily Allah doth see all that they do.,Ye mae gun'akun har fitina ndondo uga ke ma gancin adini jin baenio ulauzhe ebo Soko ya Soko gbu'ugi. To aga bea egwa kpebo to hakika Sokoe cin'ale be iri etun nazhi e'lo na.
Surah 8:40 ,        If they refuse be sure that Allah is your Protector - the best to protect and the best to help.,Ama ga zunma zheta to ye kpe wo dan'ona kede hakika Soko gayi Ndakata ye yeona: Madanla be Etsu na yi Ndakatana Madanla be Etsu taimakoe.
Surah 8:41,                                And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire (in war) a fifth share is assigned to Allah- and to the Messenger and to near relatives orphans the needy and the wayfarer- if ye do believe in Allah and in the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing- the Day of the meeting of the two forces. For Allah hath power over all things.,Ye mae kpe wo kede yan dondo na ye gade yan ganima na to Soko ga wun nini yan gutsun wun'o to yan Tuci to eza tsonbazhi to ekungizhi to eza gwa gbagizhi ye ga'afe gan yea imani jin be Sokoe be yanna yi cin be ya wuzhi Yi (MUHAMMADU)efo ekun-erikpe na efo na jama'a guba da gun dozhi na. Soko ma Etsu iko uyio ta eti yandondo.
Surah 8:42,                                  Remember ye were on the hither side of the valley and they on the farther side and the caravan on lower ground than ye. Even if ye had made a mutual appointment to meet ye would certainly have failed in the appointment: But (thus ye met) that Allah might accomplish a matter already enacted; that those who died might die after a clear Sign (had been given) and those who lived might live after a Clear Sign (had been given). And verily Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).,Ye mae pa kamina yedan kansanta natso tsoba na ama dan kansata natsoa kpe ya na gancin kodagba'azhi ma (afe kpankpanyin be eba ye) aci dan tako yebo.

Surah 8:43,                   Remember in thy dream Allah showed them to thee as few: if He had shown them to thee as many ye would surely have been discouraged and ye would surely have disputed in (your) decision; but Allah saved (you): for He knoweth well the (secrets) of (all) hearts.,Wyo mao pa kamina Soko fe la'a wu wye dan mini eleo ke jama'a degi ayio na daaci gan ula'a lawu wye kendoe adokun na da' ye ga'a wo dansun ye ga'a to gbogun ye ma'afe gbomi be dozhi eti alamari wuncin'o amma'ade Sokoa egwa kan: Hakika wyin (Soko) Uyi be kpikpe yan yannazhi fi yangban zawangizhio na.
Surah 8:44  ,                And remember when ye met He showed them to you as few in your eyes and He made you appear as contemptible in their eyes: that Allah might accomplish a matter already enacted. For to Allah do all questions go back (for decision).,Epa kamina ufe la'a wu ye na kamina ye bea gun be dozhi na eye yebo afe eza de gi umaa yetso la'fe eza de'gi dan eyeabo ebo Soko'ula hukunci'uba eti alamari ndoci na ga fe na: Alamari kpata ma eba Soko ga a kezhe lo'o.
Surah 8:45  ,         O ye who believe! When ye meet a force be firm and call Allah in remembrance much (and often); that ye may prosper:,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! ye ga bea gun gun be jama' ndocizhi eti ekun'o to yea kpe gikini. Ye mae fe tun Sokoe ye sarauyin ujin wo be wuncin yega tso guri.
Surah 8:46   ,         And obey Allah and His Messenger; and fall into no disputes lest ye lose heart and your power depart; and be patient and persevering: For Allah is with those who patiently persevere:,Ye mae la mie tu Soko be Tuci'u yin ye mae ga gbomi (yan cen leba) be dozhi ma kacin'a ye ga to gbogun gancin kagboe ma ga'a gan be yin ye mae la hakurie jin. Hakika Soko ajin udan be zanazhi gae jin hakuri nae.
Surah 8:47,                And be not like those who started from their homes insolently and to be seen of men and to hinder (men) from the path of Allah: For Allah compasseth round about all that they do.,Ye mae ga'afe ke dozhin zanazhi tinya eti fahri jin'o be ebo zawangizhia leaye na ma acie kan zawangizhi ezanda ta eti ekpa Soko: Soko maa etun nazhie lo kpatana makezhe.
Surah 8:48  ,                                 Remember Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them and said: "No one among men can overcome you this day while I am near to you": But when the two forces came in sight of each other he turned on his heels and said: "Lo! I am clear of you; lo! I see what ye see not; Lo! I fear Allah: for Allah is strict in punishment.",To kamina shaitan yin'a etun dedeazhi la'a pa nin fia na Uci gan: zandondo danbo mini zawangizhio na'a zan yekpe na mi ma dan be ye yin kpan-yin "Gancin kamina jama'a guba 'ba bea gunbe dozhi na shaitan cida'uda zunma Uci gan: "Hakika mia egwa mi wa be ye yin! mi mae le yannazhi ye le yea na ye mi mae sundan Soko: Soko ma Etsu uyio na gbota azaba jin'ona.
Surah 8:49 ,                Lo! the hypocrites say and those in whose hearts is a disease: "These people- their religion has misled them." But if any trust in Allah behold! Allah is Exalted in might Wise.,To lokaci na munafukzhi to zanazhi batan dan yangban'abo na fe gangan gan: " Adini yan za nanazhi wun'a ta fi egbin'o" zaeni ndondo na ga'a yakpe Soko na to hakika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.

Surah 8:52   ,             "(Deeds) after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and of those before them: They rejected the Signs of Allah and Allah punished them for their crimes: for Allah is Strong and Strict in punishment:,Kendoe alada yan jama'a yan fir'auna be zanazhi shiadzo na ajin kafirinci be aya Soko zhi Soko cia wan be lefiazhi hakika Soko Etsu kagbo uyio Etsu na ma gbota eba azaba jin'o na uyio.
Surah 8:53   ,              "Because Allah will never change the grace which He hath bestowed on a people until they change what is in their (own) souls: and verily Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).",Wuncin ma afe ebona hakika Soko ufe Etsu naela egbazhe de de dan mini ni'ima na uga la ya jama'a ndoci eti Eman'o na'a sai de atso ga egbazhe de de la'adan yangban'azhio.

Surah 8:54  ,              (Deeds) after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and those before them": They treated as false the Signs of their Lord: so We destroyed them for their crimes and We drowned the people of Pharaoh: for they were all oppressors and wrong-doers.,Kenadoe alada yan jama'a yan firaunazhi yi na to zanazhi shia dzo na to Yi cia jin hallaka be zunubia zhi yi cia jama'a yan fir'auna zhi gbin fi nuwan eduo kpata'ama afe azwalumizhi.
Surah 8:55 ,        For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are those who reject Him: They will not believe.,Hakika dabba na biye uma wuye gan mini dabbazhio na eba Soko'ona aga yi zanazhi-ajin kafirinci aci ye gan ajin imanianao.
Surah 8:56 ,          They are those with whom thou didst make a covenant but they break their covenant every time and they have not the fear (of Allah).,Zanazhi wyo pa alkawali be yin miniabo na gancin acia jin afe lo alkawali ya kandondo na ama'afe za nazhie tswa Sokoa amae sundan wyun'a na.
Surah 8:57  ,       If ye gain the mastery over them in war disperse with them those who follow them that they may remember.,To wyo ga bea tswo gwa mini ekun'o aala fe misali ya zazumaa'azhi ebo ala'abici ujin wo be wuncin'y uga afe sin san tu ya'a.
Surah 8:58    ,         If thou fearest treachery from any group throw back (their covenant) to them (so as to be) on equal terms: for Allah loveth not the treacherous.,Wyo ma gae be sundan yan (TITA) hainci dagan gwata jama'a ndoci zhio to a alkawalia ceya ya'a kendoe atso jin na: hakika Sokoe wa zanazhi gae jin hainci na'a.
Surah 8:59  ,     Let not the unbelievers think that they can get the better (of the godly): they will never frustrate (them).,Zanazhi ma'ajin kafirnci na aga fe kpa ye gan ayea gan gwa ma: hakika a gangwa'a.
Surah 8:60     ,                           Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power including steeds of war to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies of Allah and your enemies and others besides whom ye may not know but whom Allah doth know. Whatever ye shall spend in the cause of Allah shall be repaid unto you and ye shall not be treated unjustly.,Ye mae dan shiri boe ka'a be gwargwado yan yanna ye ga de kagbou yan kagbo na to doko yan ekun zhina ebo ye lae li makiyi Soko zhi dan to makiyi ye tso zhi to ndoci zhi nazhi jin ayeana ye kpea yea Soko de kpea ye yan dondo na ma ye ga wu fi eko Soko-ona Soko gaa egagba alheri shekpan ya ye ye ma'ade zana'ajin ye zwalunci na'a.
Surah 8:61    ,       But if the enemy incline towards peace do thou (also) incline towards peace and trust in Allah: for He is One that heareth and knoweth (all things).,Ama ga'ya kasan lo wi wa yan edun fe lafiya (be ye yin) to wyotso-oya kasan'olo wuncin wyomao lao yao kpe Soko: Hakika wyun ga yi Etsu na ma yi be kpi kpe yandondo nao Etsu na ma yi be kpikpe yandondoe na.
Surah 8:62   ,        Should they intend to deceive thee- verily Allah sufficeth thee: He it is That hath strengthened thee with His aid and with (the company of) the Believers;,Ama ga'akpa gan a'ta wyoe to hakika Soko tsa'kun ke ya wyo-yao wyun ga yi Etsu na gbo wyo ka be taimakou yin nao to be muminizhi nao.
Surah 8:63   ,                And (moreover) He hath put affection between their hearts: not if thou hadst spent all that is in the earth couldst thou have produced that affection but Allah hath done it: for He is Exalted in might Wise.,Ucia cin cin la'adan tsakani yangban'azhio be dozhi kada wyo ga yannazhifi kin bo kpatana wu ya'a wyo la cincin dan tsakani yangba yangban'azhio woa amma'ade Sokoa cincin la'adan tsakaniabo.

Surah 8:65    ,                     O Prophet! rouse the Believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongst you patient and persevering they will vanquish two hundred: if a hundred they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers: for these are a people without understanding.,Ya wyoe Annabi!

Surah 8:65 ,                        O Prophet! rouse the Believers to the fight.

Surah 8:66    ,                     For the present Allah hath lightened your (task) for He knoweth that there is a weak spot in you: But (even so) if there are a hundred of you patient and persevering they will vanquish two hundred and if a thousand they will vanquish two thousand with the leave of Allah: for Allah is with those who patiently persevere.,Gbani Sokoa sauki jin ya ye uma kpe-wo ke gbogun to wun'a lo ye na.

Soko mae dan be zanazhi gae jin hankuri nae.
Surah 8:67 ,                  It is not fitting for a prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he hath thoroughly subdued the land. Ye look for the temporal goods of this world; but Allah looketh to the Hereafter: And Allah is Exalted in might Wise.,Ugwoyin ya Annabi ndondo na wyun'ade wuzhi zhi yan ekun na'a sai de uga gun kun ucia de zankpe ta eti kinbo. Ye ye kpa dide yan eyan zwoci yan izhe zhi Soko ma Etsu zan kpe uyio Etsu hikima ma uyio.
Surah 8:68   ,      Had it not been for a previous ordainment from Allah a severe penalty would have reached you for the (ransom) that ye took.,Kagan ujin ebo hukunci Sokona'ashidzo dan litafio na'a da'a azaba na gbota na gae de ebo yannazhi yegwo eti sisa'abo na.
Surah 8:69 ,         But (now) enjoy what ye took in war lawful and good: but fear Allah: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Eboacin'o egi mini ganima nazhi yega de ekun dao uci yi halali umayi wangi na. Ye mae tswa Soko be edansun' uyin hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu ye gun uyio.
Surah 8:69   ,       But (now) enjoy what ye took in war lawful and good: but fear Allah: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Eboacin'o egi mini ganima nazhi yega de ekun dao uci yi halali umayi wangi na. Ye mae tswa Soko be edansun' uyin hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu ye gun uyio.
Surah 8:70  ,                     O Prophet! say to those who are captives in your hands: "If Allah findeth any good in your hearts He will give you something better than what has been taken from you and He will forgive you: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful."Ya wyoe Annabi! Gan ya za nazhi fi gwa ye bo ama yi za win wan ci zhi na: Soko ga tsun alheri fi mini yangban ye zhio wyun'a yae alheri natso gan yanna agwo be ye yin nae uma'ajin'e gafara. Soko ma Etsu ye gun uyio.
Surah 8:71 ,           But if they have treacherous designs against thee (O Messenger!) they have already been in treason against Allah and so hath He given (thee) power over them. And Allah so He Who hath (full) knowledge and wisdom.,Ama gae kpa gan ajin wyoe ha'ainci hakika ajin to Soko'otso hainci leani Soko cia wyo ya kagbo ta eti abo. Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 8:72  ,                                          Those who believed and adopted exile and fought for the Faith with their property and their persons in the cause of Allah as well as those who gave (them) asylum and aid- these are (all) friends and protectors one of another. As to those who believed but came not into exile ye owe no duty of protection to them until they come into exile; but if they seek your aid in religion it is your duty to help them except against a people with whom ye have a treaty of mutual alliance. And (remember) Allah seeth all that ye do.,Hakika zanazhia imani jin na aci kezhea kpe la (ke eyan de de lugwa) na aci jin jiadi (kokari) be dukiya'azhi to zanazhi twarya yan ecinbazhi na aci ke zhe jin taimako na za wuncin zhi maso yi zhi ayio ya dozhi.

Surah 8:73 ,           The Unbelievers are protectors one of another: Unless ye do this (protect each other) there would be tumult and oppression on earth and great mischief.,Zanazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na sashiazhi masoyi saashizhi ayio kagan ye jin acin'a (yeci wa dozhia) fitina ndoci ga'ajin tabatta dan kinbo gan-ni be eyan nyin na wancin nae.
Surah 8:74  ,               Those who believe and adopt exile and fight for the Faith in the cause of Allah as well as those who give (them) asylum and aid- these are (all) in very truth the Believers: for them is the forgiveness of sins and a provision most generous.,Zanazhi ma'a imani jin na acia kpe'la na aci jin jihadi (kokari) ta eti ekpa Soko ona to zanazhi twarya ecinbazhi (ya muhajiruzhi) na ama kezhe jin taimako na to za wuncinzhi gayi mumini yan gaskiya zhio gafara ga'jin tabbata ya'a to arziki na wancin na.
Surah 8:75 ,                    And those who accept Faith subsequently and adopt exile and fight for the Faith in your company- they are of you. But kindred by blood have prior rights against each other in the Book of Allah. Verily Allah is well-acquainted with all things.,Zanazhi ma ga imani jin dagan zumao na acia kpe la aci kezhe jin jihadi (kokari) keba be yeyin na to za wuncinzhi gayi zaba yezhio.

Surah 9:2 ,            Go ye then for four months backwards and forwards (as ye will) throughout the land but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah (by your falsehood) but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him.,Ebo acin'o efe dazan kpe eti kinbo har etswa gunni (kafa uyio na Soko ya kafirizhi na) ye mae kpe-ewo kede ye yegan Soko gwa woa na hakika ma Soko ga kafirizhi sunzunye.
Surah 9:3                               And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger to the people (assembled) on the day o,f the Great Pilgrimage- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then ye repent it were best for you; but if ye turn away know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith.,Emi-ya ma danna dagan eba Soko to Tuciuyin lo eba zawangizhi efo haji wanciko kede hakika Soko to Tuciu agwa'a wa be zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci nae.

Surah 9:4        ,             (But the treaties are) not dissolved with those Pagans with whom ye have entered into alliance and who have not subsequently failed you in aught nor aided any one against you. So fulfil your engagements with them to the end of their term: for Allah loveth the righteous.,Sai de zanazhi ye ga jin alkawali be yin mini zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci gancin ma ake ye yandondoa na amajin zandondo taimako be gunye kun'ana to yea alkawaliazhi she ya'har da lokaci na yega jin yeda bedozhina.

Surah 9:5   ,                      But when the forbidden months are past then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them an seize them beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Gancin-ma etswa yan alfurma zhi ga'a gwo gan to egun mushirikizhi kun bandondo na ye ga tswo'a gwa-na ye mae la'ae wan ye mae la'ae kan'edan ye mae tsoe ka'a ecinba ndondo.

Surah 9:6          ,       If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum grant it to him so that he may hear the word of Allah; and then escort him to where he can be secure. That is because they are men without knowledge.,Za eni ndondo mini mushirikizhio na ga wa tsonba wyoe ebo tswitswa'ona egwo'u tswa har u-wo egan Soko gancin ye cie la wyun'elobana uga'de aminci na wuncin mayi ebo na a'fe jama'a nazhi de kpikpea na.
Surah 9:7      ,                How can there be a league before Allah and His Messenger with the Pagans except those with whom ye made a treaty near the sacred Mosque As long as these stand true to you stand ye true to them: for Allah doth love the righteous.,Ke wun'a yi yi mushirikizhi cia de alkawali ndoci dan be Sokoe to be Tuci'u yin nao Sai de nazhi ye ga jin alkawali be yin eba massalaci haramio na.

Surah 9:8     ,          How (can there be such a league) seeing that if they get an advantage over you they respect not in you the ties either of kinship or of covenant With (fair words from) their mouths they entice you but their hearts are averse from you; and most of them are rebellious and wicked.,Ke'u yi yi nao ala'lima aga'ade zankpe ta eti yebo a'atswa zumunci ndondo ko amana be yin'a yin'o Ade'ajin afe jin yeda be ye yin yan misun'azhi yangban'azhi mae navo.

Hakika zawuncin zhi etun nae lo na a biye.
Surah 9:10     ,    In a Believer they respect not the ties either of kinship or of covenant! It is they who have transgressed all bounds.E tswa zumun ci ndondo ya muminia baleotso acia gangan alkawalia zawuncin zhi ma aga yi zanazhie gbin iya ka tu nao.
Surah 9:11    ,        But (even so) if they repent establish regular prayers and practise regular charity- they are your brethren in Faith: (thus) do We explain the Signs in detail for those who understand.,To aga bea tuba jin acia sallah ku gikini acia zakka dukiya'azhi wa to a'zhe yegi yezhi'ani dan'ona mini adinio.

Surah 9:12        ,         But if they violate their oaths after their covenant and taunt you for your Faith- fight ye the chiefs of Unfaith: for their oaths are nothing to them: that thus they may be restrained.,Ama ga kuti nazhia zhi na lo ya baci na a alkawali jin na acie ke zhe tun adini ye zhi yan (be egan de de zhi) to egun dzoshicin yan kafirin ci zhi kun.

Surah 9:15      ,    And still the indignation of their hearts. For Allah will turn (in mercy) to whom He will; and Allah is All-Knowing All-Wise.,U m a ga ewunzhe na fi yangba'azhio na la keyabo Soko ma'agwo tuba yan za na ga ba una. Soko ma Etsu hikima Uyio.
Surah 9:16           ,            Or think ye that ye shall be abandoned as though Allah did not know those among you who strive with might and main and take none for friends and protectors except Allah His Messenger and the (community of) Believers But Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.,Kashi ye kpa ye kpa gan ala ye yea lugwa tun Soko la'ala elatu dan zanazhie jin jihidi mini yebo ama la zandondo zunma Soko be tuciu yin be mumini zhi eya man cia na Sokoma yi be kpikpe yan etun nazhi ye lo na.
Surah 9:17         ,        It is not for such as join gods with Allah to visit or maintain the mosques of Allah while they witness against their own souls to infidelity. The works of such bear no fruit: In Fire shall they dwell.,Ugwoyin ya mushiriki zhi na'afe layedan masallaci Soko na'a ala'ali ma atso jin ri ya titaacin'a be etun kafirinci nae lo na.

Surah 9:18       ,               The mosques of Allah shall be visited and maintained by such as believe in Allah and the Last Day establish regular prayers and practise regular charity and fear none (at all) except Allah.

Surah 9:19                ,       Do ye make the giving of drink to pilgrims or the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque equal to (the pious service of) those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and strive with might and main in the cause of Allah They are not comparable in the sight of Allah: and Allah guides not those who do wrong.,Kashi ye ga eyanfinci na ye la ya alhaji zhi na to eye na ye ladan masallaci harami na lasan tatu be zana'a imani jin be Sokoe to be efo-zobae uci kezhe jin kokari ta ekpa Soko ebo elatu musulun ciona A'fe ye'ni eba Soko boa.

Surah 9:20       ,        Those who believe and suffer exile and strive with might and main in Allah´s cause with their goods and their persons have the highest rank in the sight of Allah: they are the people who will achieve (salvation).,Zana zhia imani jin na acia kpe la ke eyan de de lugwa na acie jin kokari ta eti ekpa Soko be dukiya'a zhi to rayia zhi na ayibe daraja na wancin gan na eba Soko zawunci zhi maaga yi eza rabo zhio.

Surah 9:23    ,              O ye who believe! take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers if they love infidelity above Faith: if any of you do so they do wrong.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 9:24    ,                            Say: If it be that your fathers your sons your brothers your mates or your kindred; the wealth that ye have gained; the commerce in which ye fear a decline: or the dwellings in which ye delight - are dearer to you than Allah or His Messenger or the striving in His cause;- then wait until Allah brings about His decision: and Allah guides not the rebellious.,Gan cin : wun'a yi gan ba ba ye zhi to egi ye zhi to yegi ye zhi to nyimi ye zhi (ko eba yazhi) to dangi ye zhi to dukiya nazhi ye kuyekan na to woce na ye sundan zunzunyana aga baye gan Soko to tuciu to kokari jin ta ekpa Soko-bo to eda zhi zhie har da kamina Sokoga'la umurni (foro)ndoci be na!

Surah 9:25   ,                   Assuredly Allah did help you in many battle-fields and on the day of Hunain: Behold! your great numbers elated you but they availed you naught: the land for all that it is wide did constrain you and ye turned back in retreat.,Hakika Soko jin ye taimako danna nazhi dokun nao to Efo Hunaynu kamina ekundo ye fe ya ye shaawa na uma kunke yaye wo be yandondo yin'a gancin ma kin cia yiku yaye bana ugwo dakan na gan cin yecia zunma zheta fe lo.
Surah 9:26,                 But Allah did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers and sent down forces which ye saw not: He punished the Unbelievers; thus doth He reward those without Faith.,Gancin Soko cia yangban shiu cin be ya tuciu to ya muminizhi uci cin ekun gun ci ndoci zhi be-yn na ye lea ye'a na uci jin zanazhia kafirinci jin na azaba wuncin ga ma yi egagba yan kafirizhio.

Surah 9:28    ,                      O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not after this year of theirs approach the Sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty soon will Allah enrich you if He wills out of His bounty for Allah is All-knowing All-wise.,Ya ye nazhi imani jin na!

Surah 9:29    ,                        Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger nor acknowledge the religion of Truth (even if they are) of the People of the Book until they pay the Jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued.,E gun zanazhie jin imani be Soko yin'ana to be Efozoba yin'ana ekun amae la yan na Soko be Tuci'u yin gaa lazhe haramu na haramua na amae jin adini yan gaskiya tsoa fi mini zanazhi ala litafi ya na har sai aga edu yan jizya ya be egwa'ayin ama' la'afe eza gbagbangizhi.
Surah 9:30  ,                    The Jews call ´Uzair a son of Allah and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah´s curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the Truth!,Ya huduzhi ma gan: uzairu egi Soko uyio" Nasarazhi ma gan: "Masihu egi Soko uyi" wuncin de egan'uyio nae dagan be misun'zhina. Amae san. La'ana Soko (kuti) ta eti abo! Ki-ila acie pan'a ke eko guru lugwao
Surah 9:31  ,                    They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of Allah and (they take as their Lord) Christ the son of Mary; yet they were commanded to worship but One Allah: there is no god but He. Praise and glory to Him: (Far is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him).,(Yahuduzhi) A' man yan'azhi la to (Nasarazhi) a man-yan'azhi la tsocizhi baci Soko acia Masihu egi maryamu la acinga.

Surah 9:32  ,            Fain would they extinguish Allah´s light with their mouths but Allah will not allow but that His light should be perfected even though the Unbelievers may detest (it).,E-wa gan a la haske-Soko'a nua ya be missun'zhi Soko mae navo sai de uga haske u gun-mi ka'a da ma kafiri zhi ga navo na.
Surah 9:33  ,           It is He Who hath sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth to proclaim it over all religion even though the Pagans may detest (it).,Wyun gayi Etsu na tun Tuci'u tun be bawu'ito be adini yan gaskiya yin'o na ebo ula wyun'u la'u ta eti Adinizhio kpata ka'a da ma mushrikunazhi (nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na ) ga navo na
Surah 9:34 ,                          O ye who believe! there are indeed many among the priests and anchorites who in Falsehood devour the substance of men and hinder (them) from the way of Allah. And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah: announce unto them a most grievous penalty-Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! ,Hakika kundondo dagan mini Ahbaruzhio (man yan yahuduzhi) to Ruhba nuzhi (man yan Nasarazhi) a jin'afe gi dukiya zazhi eti ganmanao ama'ajin afe kan zazhi eko Soko yin-da.

Surah 9:35 ,                 On the Day when heat will be produced out of that (wealth) in the fire of Hell and with it will be branded their foreheads their flanks and their backs their flanks and their backs.- "This is the (treasure) which ye buried for yourselves: taste ye then the (treasures) ye buried!",Fo na aga po'u ta eti dukiyao dan mini ena jahannamao na aci gau la'aba'a ye gun'azhio to kansan'azhio to zunma'azhio(acia fe gan'a gan):"Nana ga yi yanna ye tso ku yekan zhi-zhi ya eti tacin-yetso nao ebo acio'o efe fin azaba yan yannazhi yetso fe ku yekan (izheo na)
Surah 9:36  ,                                 The number of months in the sight of Allah is twelve (in a year)- so ordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are sacred: that is the straight usage. So wrong not yourselves therein and fight the Pagans all together as they fight you all together. But know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.,Hakika lisafi yan etswazhi (nadan eya ninio) eba Soko'o na uga yi etswa gu wo be guba yin'o kendoe uyi dan litafi Soko dagan fo-na ajin alitta sanmazhi to kin na miniabo ma gunni danbo nazhi yi Etswa alfurmazhi na.

Surah 9:37  ,                            Verily the transposing (of a prohibited month) is an addition to Unbelief: the Unbelievers are led to wrong thereby: for they make it lawful one year and forbidden another year in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by Allah and make such forbidden ones lawful. The evil of their course seems pleasing to them. But Allah guideth not those who reject Faith.,Hakika de lila-lo yegboro (yan Etswa Alfurma) Na ye jin na bibe uyio dan mini kafirincio be wun cin'y ma zanazhi'ajin kafirinci na ela'agbin ke eko wangi lugwa :e'la etswa la'azhe halali eya-ndoci eyandoci ma u'u'la'azhe haramu ebo de ala emigun'a la'adan lisafi yane tswa na Soko lazhe haramu nao. Ajin afe la yan-na Soko'a la jin haramu na a'ula'zhe halali. A etun dedezhi panin fia Soko mae la kafirizhi ke ekoa.
Surah 9:38 ,                          O ye who believe! what is the matter with you that when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah ye cling heavily to the earth Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter But little is the comfort of this life as compared with the Hereafter.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! ki'i jin ye yeo kandondo na aga gan ye gan: "E nakin gun kun ta eti ekpa Soko na "ye ajin yea nakanzhi lukpin kpe eti kinbo nao Kashi ye-yea ye dajin be eman edunfe izhe agan yan Efo zobaa Edunfe izhe ma ufe yandondo dan mini eku boa sai de te tengi.
Surah 9:39,               Unless ye go forth He will punish you with a grievous penalty and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For Allah hath power over all things.,Kagan ye dzu tinya da gunkun'a Sokoa jin'e azaba na tan na uma ga'a egwa-san la'adan'e be jama'a ndocizhi na jin ye yana (kinigibae bo) ye maa la egun ndondo tso'u woa. Soko ma Etsu uyio na de kagbo ta eti yan dondo na.
Surah 9:40 ,                                         If ye help not (your leader) (it is no matter): for Allah did indeed help him when the Unbelievers drove him out: he had no more than one companion; they two were in the cave and he said to his companion "Have no fear for Allah is with us": then Allah sent down His peace upon him and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights: for Allah is Exalted in might Wise.,Ka-gan ye jin'u taimakoa to hakika Soko'uujin taimako ni kamina kafiri zhi nyan'u dzun tinya uma yi zabaci yan zaguba kamina afi mini kpankoro na kamina ufe gan be masoyiu yin na: ga nyinyangban ma hakika Soko danbo be yi yin Soko cia yangban shi cin bea yau uci jin'u taimako be ekun gunci zhi na ye lea yea na ucia kalma yan kafiri zhi la'agba ci takotako kalma yan Soko ma ugayi elatu cio. Soko ma Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 9:41 ,             Go ye forth (whether equipped) lightly or heavily and strive and struggle with your goods and your persons in the cause of Allah. That is best for you if ye (but) knew.,Yea nakin da ekunda kamina ka ya kun-yezhi ga yi finfanci na to kamin uga lukpin na ye mae jin jihadi be dukiya yezhi to be rayi yezhi dan mini eko Soko Wunci ga yi alheri ya yeyeo ye gafe zanazhi de kpikpe na.
Surah 9:42,                      If there had been immediate gain (in sight) and the journey easy they would (all) without doubt have followed thee but the distance was long (and weighed) on them. They would indeed swear by Allah "If we only could we should certainly have come out with you": They would destroy their own souls; for Allah doth know that they are certainly lying.,Da'aci gan ele na dan jihadio na u tso-tso ba ezan da na ma danbo na wun'ayi finfan ci uyio (ekun dondoa) aga mitu wyoe ammade wahala na danbo na wun'a lokpa fia.

Surah 9:43    ,        Allah give thee grace! why didst thou grant them until those who told the truth were seen by thee in a clear light and thou hadst proved the liars,Soko fa be lefi wyo-yin. Ki'ila wyo ci ya'a izini edun feo Har sia de eza gaskiya zhi ga'a tula wyo cia ganmana zun ci zhi kpe ye.
Surah 9:43     ,       Allah give thee grace! why didst thou grant them until those who told the truth were seen by thee in a clear light and thou hadst proved the liars,Soko fa be lefi wyo-yin. Ki'ila wyo ci ya'a izini edun feo Har sia de eza gaskiya zhi ga'a tula wyo cia ganmana zun ci zhi kpe ye.
Surah 9:44 ,            Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day ask thee for no exemption from fighting with their goods and persons. And Allah knoweth well those who do their duty.,Zanazhi ga imani jin be Sokoe to be Efo zobae na a'a wa izini wyoe ebo aga jin jihadi be dukiya'azhi to be rayia zhi ma'a Soko ma Etsu kpi kpe uyio yan zanazhi gae tswa'u amae sundan'u nao.
Surah 9:45   ,          Only those ask thee for exemption who believe not in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt so that they are tossed in their doubts to and fro.,Hakika de zanazhi wa izini wyoe (gan a y'a gunkun'ana) agayi zanazhi jin imani be Sokoe to be efo zoba yin'anao yangban'azhi mae jin kelo kezhin acia jin afe jin dalo-dazhin dan mini shakka'abo.
Surah 9:46    ,          If they had intended to come out they would certainly have made some preparation therefor; but Allah was averse to their being sent forth; so He made them lag behind and they were told "Sit ye among those who sit (inactive).",Da'acigan akpakpa gan a kpakpa aatinya (lo jihadi) da'atso ga tattali jin wangi. Soko ma navo na anakin na acia ekpin lu la'adan'a edunfeo. Aci gan'agan: "Efe fedun ganni be zanazhie fe dun nae.
Surah 9:47  ,              If they had come out with you they would not have added to your (strength) but only (made for) disorder hurrying to and fro in your midst and sowing sedition among you and there would have been some among you who would have listened to them. But Allah knoweth well those who do wrong.,Da'aci gan a tin tin ya dan mini yebo da'a beye be yandondo yin'a sai de eyan nyin da ama'a dinye be lila-lo yan kulo-kuzhin'y tsakani'ebo afe wa fitina za ya ye. Mini yebo ma tukpashici nazhia da wu yannna danbo. Soko ma yi be kpikpe azwalumizhi.
Surah 9:48,               Indeed they had plotted sedition before and upset matters for thee until- the Truth arrived and the Decree of Allah became manifest much to their disgust.,Hakika shidzo ba tsozhio a wa fitina za har ma a'alamari giye fi dozhi ya ya wyoe har ma gaskiya da be alamari Soko cia tula ama'a fe zanazhie navo na.
Surah 9:49,              Among them is (many) a man who says: "Grant me exemption and draw me not into trial." Have they not fallen into trial already and indeed Hell surrounds the Unbelievers (on all sides).Ama de dan miniabo na'ajin ugan gan: ,"Yami izini edunfe wyo mao ga la fitina tswanmi-ma."To ngan a ya gun fitina boani. Hakika ma ena yan jahanama ga kafirizhi ma kezhe.
Surah 9:50               If good befalls thee it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls thee they say "We took indeed our precautions beforehand" and they turn away rejoicing.Alheri ndoci ga'a de wyoe yangban'azhi gaa nyin masiba ndoci maga'de wyoe agan: "Hakika yi ya etswa waya ti tacin yi shidzo be'dzo. "Aci ga zunma zheta acia fe ma nin.
Surah 9:51 ,            Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector": and on Allah let the Believers put their trust.Gangan: ",Yandondoa tswan yi yia sai de yan na Soko ga ka ya yi na. wyunga yi Ndakata yi yio. Muminizhi ma ala'a kpeatso Soko.
Surah 9:52   ,                  Say: "Can you expect for us (any fate) other than one of two glorious things- (Martyrdom or victory) But we can expect for you either that Allah will send his punishment from Himself or by our hands. So wait (expectant); we too will wait with you.",Gancin: kashi ye tu yandoci ye tu ya yi ban be nini mini bolo bolo gubae (nasara ko tsu tsu eri) Yi tso mae tu ye ya ye gan Soko ula azaba ndoci'ube tswan ye dagan nkoubo koma be kagbo egwa yi yin. To ezhibo fe tu-ye hakika yi tso yi tsoe tu ye ganni be ye yin.
Surah 9:53 ,          Say: "Spend (for the cause) willingly or unwillingly: not from you will it be accepted: for ye are indeed a people rebellious and wicked.",Gangan: Efe wu dukiya ye zhi ko be ban'bae yin koma be ti'ile Soko dea gwo egwa ye boa. Hakika ye yeafe jama'a na zhi yi fasiki zhi na.
Surah 9:54 ,                    The only reasons why their contributions are not accepted are: that they reject Allah and His Messenger; that they come to prayer without earnestness; and that they offer contributions unwillingly.,Uma jin yan-docikan aci gwo dukiya nazhia wu na'ayin'a sai de ebona hakika a kafirinci jin be Sokoe to be Tuciuyin na be ma e'nakin da jin salla'a sai de be nakan gban'e a mae wu dukiya'a fi eko (Soko) boa sai de be nanvoe.
Surah 9:55,                Let not their wealth nor their (following in) sons dazzle thee: in reality Allah´s plan is to punish them with these things in this life and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of Allah.,Ebo acin'o ga lugwa dukiya'azhi to egiazhi ya wyoe shahawa ma. Hakika de Sokoe kpa-kpa gan wyun'U lau jin'a azaba edunfe-izheo rayi azhi ma'alaa gan bea yin alaali ma ayi kafirizhi.
Surah 9:56 ,        They swear by Allah that they are indeed of you; but they are not of you: yet they are afraid (to appear in their true colours).,Acie zhi kuti be Sokoe kede hakika mini yebo a dan'o na ala'alima ujin mini yebo adan'a. Ama'ade afe edansunci zhi.
Surah 9:57,          If they could find a place to flee to or caves or a place of concealment they would turn straightaway thereto with an obstinate rush.,Agade bandoci de na'abici lo na ko ma kpankorozhi ko ma bandoci na'da sogun na da aga zheban da ebau acia fe dinye.
Surah 9:58,               And among them are men who slander thee in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms: if they are given part thereof they are pleased but if not behold! they are indignant!,Amade dan miniabo nazhie gan-wyo-yin dan mini gingan sadakazhio na. Kamina aga twarya ya'a miniubo na afe fa yangban kagan ama twarya ya'a dagan miniuboa wyoa leaye aga zhewun.
Surah 9:59    ,              If only they had been content with what Allah and His Messenger gave them and had said "Sufficient unto us is Allah! Allah and His Messenger will soon give us of His bounty: to Allah do we turn our hopes!" (that would have been the right course).,Da'aci gan a yeda jin jin be yan na Soko be Tuciu yin la'aya'a na aci gan: Sokou kun'u ke'u yayi Soko ma'a yayi dagan mini arziki ubo to. Tuci'u (da wun'a fe alheri ya'a gan). Hakika yi lo eba Soko tsa yi'e bavun'o.
Surah 9:60   ,                  Alms are for the poor and the needy and those employed to administer the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: (thus is it) ordained by Allah and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.,Hakika de sadakazhim (yan zakka) yan talakazhi uyio to eza gwagbagizhi to zanazhie lo tun eti zakkao na to zanazhie ta'a yangbanzhi na to sisa wuzhi zhi to gbata gicizhi to dan mini ekpa Soko to ezhiloci na dzanna ga'agba na. Ti'ile uyio dagan eba Soko. Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 9:61 ,                        Among them are men who molest the Prophet and say "He is (all) ear." Say "He listens to what is best for you: he believes in Allah has faith in the Believers and is a Mercy to those of you who believe." But those who molest the Messenger will have a grievous penalty.,Amade dan miniabo nazhie jin Annabi gun na aciajin afe gangan: "Tukpa ko uyio" (wyun'e shi tukpa ko yan egan ndondo)! Gangan: " Tukpako yan alheri ya ye wyun'e jin imani be Sokoe uma yi yegun ya zanazhia imani jin mini yebo na. Zanazhi mae jin Tuci Soko gun na azaba na tan na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 9:62 ,          To you they swear by Allah. In order to please you: But it is more fitting that they should please Allah and His Messenger if they are Believers.,A'jin Afe zhi kuti yaye ebo ade ba'ade yade ye. Soko be Tuci'u yin ma aga -- yin na awa yedaa nao wun'ayi Muminizhi ayio na.
Surah 9:63  ,             Know they not that for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger is the Fire of Hell- wherein they shall dwell. That is the supreme disgrace.,Kashi a kpe kpea kede zandondo na gae le Soko ba be Tuci'u yin na kede hakika ena jahannama ga'ajin tabbata ya wyun'a Bagabo ama'afi tutunyin'o. Wuncin ma zunye sun uyio na gbota na.
Surah 9:64  ,              The Hypocrites are afraid lest a Sura should be sent down about them showing them what is (really passing) in their hearts. Say: "Mock ye! But verily Allah will bring to light all that ye fear (should be revealed).,Munafukizhie sundan na'acin sura ndoci be etiabo na'a ya'a labari yan yannazhi fi yangban'azhio na. Gangan: "Efe la'mide hakika Soko ga yan na ye sundan na la'a tinya.
Surah 9:65,            If thou dost question them they declare (with emphasis): "We were only talking idly and in play." Say: "Was it at Allah and His Signs and His Messenger that ye were mocking",Hakika ma wyo ga gbin'agan (ki-egan dan zunma bo) a'gangan: "Hakika de yie ba zayiba yicie dzodzo." Gangan: "Ngba Soko be ayauzhi be Tuci'u yin ga ye ela mio''
Surah 9:65,            If thou dost question them they declare (with emphasis): "We were only talking idly and in play." Say: "Was it at Allah and His Signs and His Messenger that ye were mocking",Hakika ma wyo ga gbin'agan (ki-egan dan zunma bo) a'gangan: "Hakika de yie ba zayiba yicie dzodzo." Gangan: "Ngba Soko be ayauzhi be Tuci'u yin ga ye ela mio''
Surah 9:66  ,             Make ye no excuses: ye have rejected Faith after ye had accepted it. If We pardon some of you We will punish others amongst you for that they are in sin.,Ega ta uzuri ndondo ma hakika ye ya ajin kafirinci baci na yea imani jin na. Yi ma ga'a fa be lefi zandocizhi mini ye bo Yi ga zandocizhi jin azaba ebo na hakika a'fe le fi jin cizhina.
Surah 9:67 ,                 The Hypocrites men and women (have an understanding) with each other: They enjoin evil and forbid what is just and are close with their hands. They have forgotten Allah; so He hath forgotten them. Verily the Hypocrites are rebellious and perverse.,Munafuki bagizhi to munafuki yinzagizhi zabadozhi ayio a'jin afe jin foro be eyan dede ama'jin afe kan etun guruzhi acie la egwa'azhi wa. A Soko batan eboacin'o Soko cia tso batan ga. Hakika munafukizhi agayi fasikizhio.
Surah 9:67  ,                The Hypocrites men and women (have an understanding) with each other: They enjoin evil and forbid what is just and are close with their hands. They have forgotten Allah; so He hath forgotten them. Verily the Hypocrites are rebellious and perverse.,Munafuki bagizhi to munafuki yinzagizhi zabadozhi ayio a'jin afe jin foro be eyan dede ama'jin afe kan etun guruzhi acie la egwa'azhi wa. A Soko batan eboacin'o Soko cia tso batan ga. Hakika munafukizhi agayi fasikizhio.
Surah 9:68   ,            Allah hath promised the Hypocrites men and women and the rejecters of Faith the fire of Hell: Therein shall they dwell: Sufficient is it for them: for them is the curse of Allah and an enduring punishment-,Soko jin munafuki bagizhi to munafuki yinzagizhi to kafirizhi alkawali yan ena jahannama bagabo afio tutun yin'o. Wyun' ga'a kun'akeo. Soko ma'a bo mi azaba na ma'a fedun na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 9:69   ,                            As in the case of those before you: they were mightier than you in power and more flourishing in wealth and children. They had their enjoyment of their portion: and ye have of yours as did those before you; and ye indulge in idle talk as they did. They!- their work are fruitless in this world and in the Hereafter and they will lose (all spiritual good).,Ke kotonci yan zanazhi shi yedzo na agbo'ka gan ye ama de dukiyazhi to egizhi gan ye aci wo ma be raboa yin yetso ma wo ma be rabo ye yin kendo zanazhi shiyedzo na wo ma be raboa yin na yema fe dzo izhe iri kendoe atso dzo izhe na.

Surah 9:70   ,                      Hath not the story reached them of those before them- the People of Noah and ´Ad and Thamud; the People of Abraham the men of Midian and the cities overthrown. To them came their messengers with clear signs. It is not Allah Who wrongs them but they wrong their own souls.,Beke labari zanazhi shidzo na be ya aa na jama'a yan Nuhuzhi to Aduzhi to Samuduzhi to jama'a yan Ibrahimazhi to zaba madyana to kin nazhi azhekpe na Tuci'azhi be ya'be bayanizhi.

Surah 9:71  ,                     The Believers men and women are protectors one of another: they enjoin what is just and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers practise regular charity and obey Allah and His Messenger. On them will Allah pour His mercy: for Allah is Exalted in power Wise.,Mumini bagizhi to mumini yinzagizhi sashiazhi masoyizhi ayio ya sashi ejin foro be etun guruzhi a mae kan etu dedezhi amae ku sallah gikini amae wa zakka dukiya'azhi amae gba Soko be Tuci'u yin.

Surah 9:72      ,                 Allah hath promised to Believers men and women gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein and beautiful mansions in gardens of everlasting bliss. But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of Allah: that is the supreme felicity.,Soko jin mumini bagizhi to mumini yinzagizhi alkawali wyun'a la'a gandan emi Aljannazhio nazhi sangizhie je fi takoabona ama'afibofi tutunyin be edunfe ba managizhi dan mini emi Aljannazhio ganni be yeda jin'y dagan eba Soko natso wancin ganna.

Surah 9:73,          O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the Hypocrites and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell- an evil refuge indeed.,Ya wyoe Annabi! Gun kafirizhi to munafikizhi kun wyo mao lao kuo gikini beayin be kagboe. Ezhekeba'a ma uga yi jahannamao. Bibi ma'ajin tabbata ya ezhe keba wuncin.
Surah 9:74,                                             They swear by Allah that they said nothing (evil) but indeed they uttered blasphemy and they did it after accepting Islam; and they meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out: this revenge of theirs was (their) only return for the bounty with which Allah and His Messenger had enriched them! If they repent it will be best for them; but if they turn back (to their evil ways) Allah will punish them with a grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter: They shall have none on earth to protect or help them.,A'jin a'fe zhi kuti be Sokoe ke agan'acin'a na alalima hakika agan gan yan kafirinci ama'ajin kafirinci baci musulunciabo ama jin kokari dan (wiwa) yan na a'de jin jin wun'a na (uga yi wuwu nae wagan a wu Annabi nao).

Surah 9:75,           Amongst them are men who made a covenant with Allah that if He bestowed on them of His bounty they would give (largely) in charity and be truly amongst those who are righteous.,A ma de miniabo najin Soko alkawali na Hakika Soko ga twarya yayi dagan mini falalaubo hakika yi yiajin sadaka hakika ma yi ga'fe da mini zaguruzhio.
Surah 9:76,        But when He did bestow of His bounty they became covetous and turned back (from their covenant) averse (from its fulfilment).,Kamina ubea la ya'a dagan mini falalaubo na acia yanbotan beuyin acia zunma zheta aciapanya ke shishe alkawali lugwa.
Surah 9:76  ,      But when He did bestow of His bounty they became covetous and turned back (from their covenant) averse (from its fulfilment).,Kamina ubea la ya'a dagan mini falalaubo na acia yanbotan beuyin acia zunma zheta aciapanya ke shishe alkawali lugwa.
Surah 9:77,              So He hath put as a consequence hypocrisy into their hearts (to last) till the Day whereon they shall meet Him: because they broke their covenant with Allah and because they lied (again and again).,Ucia zoba alamaria la'afe munafinci dan mini yangban'abo har da fo na aga be gun be uyin na ebo lenba yan alkawali na'ajin Soko na to ganmana nae zun nao.
Surah 9:78 ,         Know they not that Allah doth know their secret (thoughts) and their secret counsels and that Allah knoweth well all things unseen,Kashi ade kpikpe dea kede hakika Soko yibe kpikpe yan asiriazhi to egan swiswociazhia kede hakikama Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio yan yannazhia swokpata na'a.
Surah 9:79 ,                  Those who slander such of the believers as give themselves freely to (deeds of) charity as well as such as can find nothing to give except the fruits of their labour- and throw ridicule on them- Allah will throw back their ridicule on them: and they shall have a grievous penalty.,Zanazhie gangan dede (yan aibi) eti zanazhie lo tun alheri mini muminizhio ebo sadaka jin'o na to zanazhi de yan dondoa saide na'aga da jin kokari cide na (acie la'ajin sadaka na) gancin acie la'a mi Sokoa ga'agba be emi la'azhi azaba nama tan na wun'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 9:80,                        Whether thou ask for their forgiveness or not (their sin is unforgivable): if thou ask seventy times for their forgiveness Allah will not forgive them: because they have rejected Allah and His Messenger: and Allah guideth not those who are perversely rebellious.,Ka wyo ga ba gafara ya'a koma wyo ba gafara ya'a(ye ni uyio) ka wyo ga wa gafara ya'a zu adwani to Sokoa fa bea yin'a. Ebo na ajin kafirinci be Sokoe to be Tuci'u yin. Soko mae la fasikizhi ke eko gurua.
Surah 9:81,                          Those who were left behind (in the Tabuk expedition) rejoiced in their inaction behind the back of the Messenger of Allah: they hated to strive and fight with their goods and their persons in the cause of Allah: they said "Go not forth in the heat." Say "The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat." If only they could understand!,Zanazhia yadan zunmao na afa yangban be edun na'afe zunma yan Tuci Soko na ama navo na'ajin jihadi be dukiya'azhi to be rayiazhi dan eko Soko na aci gan: "Ega dzuntinya lo ekunda dan ba nawo yan yigidioma; Gangan: "Ngan ena jahannamam wona gan sarauyin." Da'aci gan egan gae yea ye na.
Surah 9:82 ,      Let them laugh a little: much will they weep: a recompense for the (evil) that they do.,Ebo acin'o aga' man-tsan a'man-tsan degi ama'a tigi na dokun na wuncin mayi egagba yan woce dede nae ce na.
Surah 9:83,                        If then Allah bring thee back to any of them and they ask thy permission to come out (with thee) say: "Never shall ye come out with me nor fight an enemy with me: for ye preferred to sit inactive on the first occasion: Then sit ye (now) with those who lag behind.",To Soko ga bea wyo la zheban da eba jama'a ndocizhi miniabo aci wa izini be wyo yin yan tintinya to gangan: "yea tinya be mi yin'a har abada ye ma'a gun makiri ndondo kun be mi yin'a. Hakika ye yea ye da jin be edunfe ca bae be dzo ebo acin'o eda fedun'e be inzagizhi nazhie fe dun zhi zunmao na.
Surah 9:84 ,                Nor do thou ever pray for any of them that dies nor stand at his grave; for they rejected Allah and His Messenger and died in a state of perverse rebellion.,Wyo mao ga jin sallah ta eti ekun zaeni ndondo naga'a tsu na ma har abada wyo mao ga gikini eba kabari ubo ma. Hakika aajin kafirinci be Sokoe to be Tuci'u yin ama'a tsu alalima ayi fasikizhi.
Surah 9:85  ,             Nor let their wealth nor their (following in) sons dazzle thee: Allah´s plan is to punish them with these things in this world and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of Allah.,Dukiya'zhi ma to egiazhi aga ya wyoe sha'awa ma. Hakika de Sokoe kpa kpa gan wyun'a jin'a azaba jin be ayin dan izhe na nao rayiazhi ma'u la'ujin hallaka ala'alima ayi kafirizhi.
Surah 9:86  ,               When a Sura comes down enjoining them to believe in Allah and to strive and fight along with His Messenger those with wealth and influence among them ask thee for exemption and say: "Leave us (behind): we would be with those who sit (at home).",Gancin ma aga sura cinzhin kede: yea imani jin be Sokoe na ye mae jin jihadi ganni be Tuci'u yin. Zanazhi yi eza bagwozhi miniabo na afe wa izini wyoe acia gangan: A yi ya be zanazhi fedun zhizhi 9nbo) na.
Surah 9:87  ,        They prefer to be with (the women) who remain behind (at home): their hearts are sealed and so they understand not.,A yeda jin kede a zhia nbo ganni be inzagizhina. Acia yangbanzhi te ebo acin'o eganzhi cie yea bea.
Surah 9:88   ,          But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive and fight with their wealth and their persons: for them are (all) good things: and it is they who will prosper.,Amma'de Tuci (soko) to zanazhia imani jin be uyin na ajin jihadi (kokari ta eti ekpa Soko) be dukiyazhi to rayiazhi. Zawuncinzhi yi be egagba yan alherizhi za wuncinzhi ma agayi eza rabozhio.
Surah 9:89,            Allah hath prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein: that is the supreme felicity.,Soko jin shiri ya'a yan Aljannazhi na nuwan zhie je fi takoa bo na ama'a fibo tutunyin. Wuncin ga ma yi rabo na wancin nao.
Surah 9:90,                And there were among the desert Arabs (also) men who made excuses and came to claim exemption; and those who were false to Allah and His Messenger (merely) sat inactive. Soon will a grievous penalty seize the Unbelievers among them.,Zanazhi yi eza uzurizhi mini za banzunmazhio na cida be ebo ajin izinia ya'aa zanazhi ma zunwan ta Soko be Tuci'u yin na a fedun'a zhizhi. Be le yin azaba na tanna ga'a zanazhi jin kafirinci miniabo nade.
Surah 9:91,                         There is no blame on those who are infirm or ill or who find no resources to spend (on the cause) if they are sincere (in duty) to Allah and His Messenger: no ground (of complaint) can there be against such as do right: and Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Le fi danbo ta eti eza gbogun zhi boa to guncizhi lefi ma ta eti zanazhi ade yan na'awu fi eko Soko ona'a aga yanagban'azhi tadzu ebo Soko be Tuci'u yin na'a. Le fi ndondo ma ta eti zanazhie jin bolobolona'a. Soko ma Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun.
Surah 9:92  ,                    Nor (is there blame) on those who came to thee to be provided with mounts and when thou saidst "I can find no mounts for you" they turned back their eyes streaming with tears of grief that they had no resources wherewith to provide the expenses.Lefi ma ta eti zanazhi kamina aga be eba wyoe ebo wyo yola yan Tucizhio ya'a wyoci gan: "Mide yanna mia la ye ta na'a" acia zheban ala'alima eyeazhie ya egiye ebo yangban nyin'o na ade yandondo na'a wu fi eko Soko boa nao.
Surah 9:93    ,              The ground (of complaint) is against such as claim exemption while they are rich. They prefer to stay with the (women) who remain behind: Allah hath sealed their hearts; so they know not (What they miss).,Hakika lefi ta eti za nazhie wa izini wyoe (ebo aga jin jihadi ma) ala'ali ma ayi eza bagwozhi na. Acia yeda jin gan a zhizhi (nbo) be inzagizhi Soko cia (haske) yangban'azhi ta ebo acin'o aci de kpikpea.
Surah 9:94   ,                          They will present their excuses to you when ye return to them. Say thou: "Present no excuses: we shall not believe you: Allah hath already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you: It is your actions that Allah and His Messenger will observe: in the end will ye be brought back to Him Who knoweth what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.",Afe la uzuri'azhi be eba ye kamina ye ga zheban da tsun'a na.

Gancin acia la ye zhebanlo eba Etsu na wun kpikpe yan na'aswo kpata na to na'a tula na Ucia yaye labari yan etun nazhi ye lo pkata na.
Surah 9:95  ,               They will swear to you by Allah when ye return to them that ye may leave them alone. So leave them alone: For they are an abomination and Hell is their dwelling-place-a fitting recompense for the (evil) that they did.,A'fezhi kuti ya ye be Sokoe kamina ye ga zheban da tsun'a na ebode ye lae dzun gan'abo to yea dzun gan'abo hakika shikan ayio ecin ba'a ma uga yi jahannamao wuncin ma yi egagba yan woce nazhie ce na.
Surah 9:96   ,          They will swear unto you that ye may be pleased with them but if ye are pleased with them Allah is not pleased with those who disobey.,A fe zhi kuti ya ye ebo de ye la yedae jin bea yin. Ka ye ga yeda jin bea yin to hakika Sokoe jin yeda be jama'a nazhi yi fasikizhi naa.
Surah 9:96  ,           They will swear unto you that ye may be pleased with them but if ye are pleased with them Allah is not pleased with those who disobey.,A fe zhi kuti ya ye ebo de ye la yedae jin bea yin. Ka ye ga yeda jin bea yin to hakika Sokoe jin yeda be jama'a nazhi yi fasikizhi naa.
Surah 9:97   ,            The Arabs of the desert are the worst in Unbelief and hypocrisy and most fitted to be in ignorance of the command which Allah hath sent down to His Messenger: But Allah is All-knowing All-Wise.,Eza banzunmazhi a gbo ka gan eba kafirinci jin'y be munafinci jin'y aga ma -- 'aci yin gan'o ebo na ade kpikpe yan hukuncizhi na Soko cin be ya Tuci'u naa. Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 9:98  ,             Some of the desert Arabs look upon their payments as a fine and watch for disasters for you: on them be the disaster of evil: for Allah is He That heareth and knoweth (all things).,Ama de dan mini eza banzunmazhio nazhie le yanna uga wu (fi eko Soko) na ye ke dashi na acia jin afe wa gan masibazhi a'laa cin'a dan ye cincin yan masibazhi eti atso bo wun'a tao. Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio.
Surah 9:99  ,                        But some of the desert Arabs believe in Allah and the Last Day and look on their payments as pious gifts bringing them nearer to Allah and obtaining the prayers of the Messenger. Aye indeed they bring them nearer (to Him): soon will Allah admit them to His Mercy: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Amade dan mini eza banzunmazhio na'a imani jin be Sokoe to be efo zobae na amae la yan nazhi aga wu na ke eyan tsonbazhi na ayio lo eba Soko umayi aduwa(yan salati) ya Tuci Soko na.

Surah 9:100    ,                    The vanguard (of Islam)- the first of those who forsook (their homes) and of those who gave them aid and (also) those who follow them in (all) good deeds- well-pleased is Allah with them as are they with Him: for them hath He prepared gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein for ever: that is the supreme felicity.,Zanazhi ma'a shidzo amayi za mafarizhi mini muhajiruzhio to ansaruzhi na to zanazhi la mitua zunmao be etun wangizhina Sokoa yeda jin bea yin atso ma'ajin be'Uyin.

Surah 9:101 ,                    Certain of the desert Arabs round about you are hypocrites as well as (desert Arabs) among the Medina folk: they are obstinate in hypocrisy: thou knowest them not: We know them: twice shall We punish them: and in addition shall they be sent to a grievous penalty.,To dagan mini zanazhi maye -- ba mini banzunmacizhio na munafikizhi dan miniabo to mini za zhi-nin yan Madinao zanazhi gi gba ta eti munafuncio na dan bo wyoa kpea yea Yi tsa kpea yeo.

Surah 9:102 ,               Others (there are who) have acknowledged their wrong-doings: they have mixed an act that was good with another that was evil. Perhaps Allah will turn unto them (in Mercy): for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,To ndocizhi ma danbo atsoa ye da jin be lefiazhi (a emi -- ) a etun wangi bokeba be ndoci nayi dede nae. Kengi uyio na Soko'agwo tuba jin'a na. Hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 9:103   ,            Of their goods take alms that so thou mightest purify and sanctify them; and pray on their behalf. Verily thy prayers are a source of security for them: And Allah is One Who heareth and knoweth.-- ,sadaka dagan mini dukiya'azhio wyo'olaadi wyo la'ao tadzu be'uyin. Wyo mae ba aduwao ya'a.

Surah 9:104 ,              Know they not that Allah doth accept repentance from His votaries and receives their gifts of charity and that Allah is verily He the Oft-Returning Most Merciful,Kashi akpe-kpe gan Soko ga yi Etsu nae -- tuba dagan eba wuzhiu zhio na'a Umae -- to sadakazhia hakika ma soko Etsu Tuba uyio ma uyia'a
Surah 9:105,               And say: "Work (righteousness): Soon will Allah observe your work and His Messenger and the Believers: Soon will ye be brought back to the knower of what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.",Wyo mae gangan :Efe lo tun bele yin Sokoa le etun'e ye to Tuci (wun'a le ye ) to muninizhi gancin ma aga ye la'a zheban da eba Etsu na wun kpikpe yan naa'so na to na'a tula na gancin ucia ya ye labari etun nazhi ye lo na.
Surah 9:106     ,      There are (yet) others held in suspense for the command of Allah whether He will punish them or turn in mercy to them: and Allah is All-Knowing Wise.,To ndocizhi ma danbo nazhi epata ya hukunci Soko eti abona ko (uga bau) ujin'a azaba ko ma (wyun'a bau) ujin'a gafara. Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 9:107                ,       And there are those who put up a mosque by way of mischief and infidelity - to disunite the Believers - and in preparation for one who warred against Allah and His Messenger aforetime. They will indeed swear that their intention is nothing but good; But Allah doth declare that they are certainly liars.,Za nazhi ma'a masallaci la ebo egun jin'o na be kafirinci be gingan (kpere-kpere) tsakani musulumizhio na be esobae ya za nazhie gun Soko be Tuci'u yin ekun shido batsozhio na hakika ma a fe zhi kuti gan:"yide kpa yandondoa sai de alheri "ala'li ma sokoe jin ri ke hakika gan mana zuncizhi ayio na.
Surah 9:108    ,                  Never stand thou forth therein. There is a mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety; it is more worthy of the standing forth (for prayer) therein. In it are men who love to be purified; and Allah loveth those who make themselves pure.,Ga gikini (jin salla) miniabo ma har abada. Hakika masallaci na'a tu ta dansun Soko dagan caba efoe na uga -- yin gan na wyoe jin salla dan miniubo nao. Miniubo eza bagi ndocizhi danbo nazhie wa lili na hakika ma Soko ajin ufe wa eza lilicizhi.
Surah 9:109    ,                      Which then is best - he that layeth his foundation on piety to Allah and His good pleasure - or he that layeth his foundation on an undermined sand-cliff ready to crumble to pieces and it doth crumble to pieces with him into the fire of Hell. And Allah guideth not people that do wrong.,Ngba za na'a eba u tu ta eti dan sun Soko'o be wiwa yan yedau yin na uga de alheri gan'o-kashi za na la ba tu'u ta eti gushe misun'o nae wa gan wun'a banfi na Ucia banfi be wyun tsoe dan mini ena jahannamao. Soko mae la jama'a yan azwalumizhi ke eko gurua.
Surah 9:110   ,           The foundation of those who so build is never free from suspicion and shakiness in their hearts until their hearts are cut to pieces. And Allah is All-Knowing Wise.,Eba na'tu na wun'a la keyaboa uga'azhe eyan ke lo kezhin fi yangban'azhio har da kamina yangban'azhia bea sa ya na Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima.
Surah 9:111      ,                              Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth through the Law the Gospel and the Qur´an: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme.,Hakika Sokoa shi dagan eba muminizhio rayiazhi to dukiya'zhi ebo egagba aljanna na'a la ya'a na.

Surah 9:112        ,       Those that turn (to Allah) in repentance; that serve Him and praise Him; that wander in devotion to the cause of Allah: that bow down and prostrate themselves in prayer; that enjoin good and forbid evil; and observe the limit set by Allah;- (These do rejoice). So proclaim the glad tidings to the Believers.,Za nazhie jin tuba na zanazhie jin bauta ya Soko na zanazhie jin yebo ya Soko na zanazhie fe azum na zanazhie jin rukuna zanazhie jin sujada na zanazhie jin dozhi foro be etun wangi na zanazhie kan etun dede na to za nazhie tswa iyaka Soko zhina. Wyo mao ya labari yangban fao ya Muminizhi.
Surah 9:113  ,                 It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should pray for forgiveness for Pagans even though they be of kin after it is clear to them that they are companions of the Fire.,Ugwo yin ya Annabi to zanazhia imani jin na'a na'aba gafara ya zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci na'a ka'a da ma agafe eza afe eza ena jahimuzhi na'a.
Surah 9:114      ,               And Abraham prayed for his father´s forgiveness only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allah he dissociated himself from him: for Abraham was most tender-hearted forbearing.Gafara na ma Ibrahima wa ya baba'una u fea sai de ebo alkawali ndoci na'ujin'una kamina ma ubea tula yau kede hakika (babau) wun'azhe makiri Soko na wyun'a egwau wa be uyio.

Surah 9:115  ,               And Allah will not mislead a people after He hath guided them in order that He may make clear to them what to fear (and avoid)- for Allah hath knowledge of all things.,Soko ma wyun'e gbin jama'a ndondoa baci na uga'wuba na'a sai de uga bayani jin ya'bedzo yan yannazhi -- yin a tswa na. Hakika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio yan yandondo.
Surah 9:116 ,               Unto Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He giveth life and He taketh it. Except for Him ye have no protector nor helper.,Hakika Soko ga wun mulki sanmazhi to kin yin'o Wyun'e dan rayi umae wu rayi. Ye ma de zan doci baci soko na'a fe ndakata be taimako jinci ya ye na'a.
Surah 9:117 ,                         Allah turned with favour to the Prophet the Muhajirs and the Ansar- who followed him in a time of distress after that the hearts of a part of them had nearly swerved (from duty); but He turned to them (also): for He is unto them Most Kind Most Merciful.,Hakika Sokoa tuba yan Annabi gwo to muhajirunazhi (nazhi kpela dagan makao lo madina na ) to Ansaruzhi (madinacizhi) nazhia mi tu Annabi dan lokaci yan ezo'ona baci na yangban Zandoncizhi miniabo a tsoba na uga zhegba na gancin Soko ci gwo tuba'a .

Surah 9:118  ,                            (He turned in mercy also) to the three who were left behind; (they felt guilty) to such a degree that the earth seemed constrained to them for all its spaciousness and their (very) souls seemed straitened to them- and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah (and no refuge) but to Himself. Then He turned to them that they might repent: for Allah is Oft-Returning Most Merciful.,Soko ma gwo tuba yan zaguta nazhia badan zunmaonahar ma kin (nana) wu'a pin'a bana ugwope da kan na rayi azhicia pin atso atso cia kpe wo kede edzunba ndondo danbo dagan eba Sokoboa saide be eban'zhe lo ebau na Gancin Soko ci gwa tuba'aebo ma ade ba'a la'a kua gikini be tuba jin'y.

Surah 9:120   ,                                                It was not fitting for the people of Medina and the Bedouin Arabs of the neighbourhood to refuse to follow Allah´s Messenger nor to prefer their own lives to his: because nothing could they suffer or do but was reckoned to their credit as a deed of righteousness- whether they suffered thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of Allah or trod paths to raise the ire of the Unbelievers or received any injury whatever from an enemy: for Allah suffereth not the reward to be lost of those who do good;-,Ugwo yin na jama'a yan Madinacizhi to za nazhi ma'a gwo ba dagan mini za banzunmazhio na na aga ce leba gbigba yan Tuci Soko na'a ama'aga wa rayiazhi agan rayiu ma.

Surah 9:121     ,            Nor could they spend anything (for the cause) - small or great- nor cut across a valley but the deed is inscribed to their credit: that Allah may requite their deed with the best (possible reward).,To yandondo na aga wu tetengi na to wanciko na'aga wu na to kpankoro na aga labici dana sai Soko ga la'ada ka yaa ebo Soko'u ga'agba be egagba na gyegan etu nazhi afe lo na.
Surah 9:122  ,                   Nor should the Believers all go forth together: if a contingent from every expedition remained behind they could devote themselves to studies in religion and admonish the people when they return to them- that thus they (may learn) to guard themselves (against evil).,Uma gwayin na Musulumizhi kpata ga tinya da ekunda na'a kia la acia de jama'a ndocizhi dagan mini kansan ndondo nazhia tinya da wa fahimta adini za'a naa yin'o Ebo ajin jama'a yan'azhi gangba kamina aga zheban lo eba'a na ujin wo be wuncin'y aga fe za nazhie tswa do ka Soko na.
Surah 9:123  ,             O ye who believe! fight the unbelievers who gird you about and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 9:124    ,             Whenever there cometh down a sura some of them say: "Which of you has had His faith increased by it" Yea those who believe- their faith is increased and they do rejoice.,Ama ga sura ndoci cin be ade dan miniabo na'ajin ugangan: "Ngba zi'i mini yebo (egan) nanazhi bea imanio To ammade zanazhia imani jin na ubea imaniamae fa yangban be uyio.
Surah 9:125 ,          But those in whose hearts is a disease- it will add doubt to their doubt and they will die in a state of Unbelief.,Amaade za nazhi batan fi yangban'azhio na ubea shikan be ta eti shikan'azhio acia tsu ala'ali ma ayi kafirizhi.
Surah 9:126   ,            See they not that they are tried every year once or twice Yet they turn not in repentance and they take no heed.,Kashi a'le ye le gan e'man 'acin le be fitinazhi mini eya ndondo; zunni koma zu guba'a Gancin ma e'jin tu'uba'a amae kpa yea.
Surah 9:126 ,              See they not that they are tried every year once or twice Yet they turn not in repentance and they take no heed.,Kashi a'le ye le gan e'man 'acin le be fitinazhi mini eya ndondo; zunni koma zu guba'a Gancin ma e'jin tu'uba'a amae kpa yea.
Surah 9:127     ,               Whenever there cometh down a Sura they look at each other (saying) "Doth anyone see you" Then they turn aside: Allah hath turned their hearts (from the light); for they are a people that understand not.,Kamina ma aga sura ndoci cin be na sashiazhi miniabo ciafe ba'ye cin sashi le (agan gan:) "Ngba ade zandoci nae le ye ye na Gancin aci ga zhe ban.
