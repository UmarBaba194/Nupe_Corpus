Nupe Poem for late Etsu Nupe Dr. Umaru Sanda 
 
A glossa l tree has fallen. 
Many liquids have poured away.
 The ground cannot contain them. 
 
Legacies of unmeasurable are left scattered around. 
generations now and yet to be born can find its trances for benefits. 
 
D r. Umaru S anda an everlasting shadow. 
O ur tears c annot not weep out but on voyage of dripping. 
C ontinue to be in the bossom of lord.
