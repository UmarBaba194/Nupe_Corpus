The Nupe adage says "An exclusion of one broom can't s top others from sweeping" But! What about The deceased of Baba Umaru? 
 
Pose! Does an empty sack stand solitary?
 The Nupe's and Nupe land elevated by the grace of Baba Umaru. 
 
Congratulations to Nupenchizhi for having a rare King. 
Umaru the Nupe hero, 
Pose! Who dares aggrieved by a divine decree? 
Baba Umaru is no more, but we felt his presence frequently. 
 
I'm most grateful to my parent for naming me after the hero! Baba Umaru. 
To God be the glory!
