Kasa!
 The grandfather of many is no more, 
You bid farewell to the land afar,
 You left very early, 
You left hurriedly with happiness,
 Happiness circled your eyeballs, 
 
Oh oh! You don’t talk for long,
 Only to sprinkle cold water, 
You don’t want what will bother someone, 
Only to console one,
 You don’t make someone cry,
 Only to whip the tears,
 If you see tears, 
Your body gets Goosebumps, 
You said “God didn’t make us cry, 
Should we make ourselves cry?” 
 
When you w ere king, 
You were the kind of father everyone prayed to have. 
 
Smiling every time, 
You didn’t get angry, 
Even if you got angry, 
It’s not a human that made you upset,
 Because even the human knows the night that chased the owl, 
 
If you see someone in the su n,
 You are not reluctant to bring him to shade, 
7 
 
 
Unless, the person has bid himself farewell, 
 
If you see someone annoyed with God’s work, 
that person has no patience, 
You sprinkle cold water on them,
 You say; “don’t be angry with God's work” Because he who gets angry with God, 
That person has displeased God, 

Someone doesn’t displease God and go freely, 
 
Etsu Umaru doesn’t have any problem, 
He doesn’t shun people, 
He doesn’t keep things in mind, 
He doesn’t lie, 
He doesn’t do what will make one cry. 
 
Oh God! You are the King of everything, 
You make one to cry, 
You make one to laugh,
 If you like, 
You turn the mountain into a house,
 If you also like, 
You turn the house into a mountain, 
All is your decision ,
 
You don’t do something and they complain that it’s wrong But the death of Sand,
 
Can we ask why it was so?
 With that we are too small, 
We haven’t reached there, 
 
God forgive Etsu Sanda Harbor him in your house, 

Increase the shade in his grave,
 Make us meet in the hereafter with happiness Amin. 
 
Etsu Umaru goodbye, 
Etsu Sanda till another time,
 Etsu of yesterday till morning.
