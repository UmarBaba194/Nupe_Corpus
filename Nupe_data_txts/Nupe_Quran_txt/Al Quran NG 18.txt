Surah 18:1  ,         Praise be to Allah Who hath sent to His Servant the Book and hath allowed therein no Crookedness:,Yebo kpata'ajin tabbata ya SokoEtsu nacin litafi be ya wuzhiu uma la egbakpan-ko kandanbo ndondo danboa na.
Surah 18:2  ,            (He hath made it) Straight (and Clear) in order that He may warn (the godless) of a terrible Punishment from Him and that He may give Glad Tidings to the Believers who work righteous deeds that they shall have a goodly Reward,(Litafi uyio na yi gboro na ebo'u naebo'u na wun be azaba natso gbota dan nko Soko-ona Uma'u ya muminizhi nazhie lotun wangizhi na labari yangbanfa kede; hakika egagba nayi wangi na gaajin tabbata ya'a na.Surah 18:3  Wherein they shall remain for ever:Ama'a fe (dun) fe fibo tutun yin.
Surah 18:4 ,    Further that He may warn those (also) who say "Allah hath begotten a son":,Uma'u jin zanazhi gan gan Soko yibe egi'ina gangba.
Surah 18:5      ,         No knowledge have they of such a thing nor had their fathers. It is a grievous thing that issues from their mouths as a saying what they say is nothing but falsehood!,Ade kpikpe ndondo eti wuncin boa ka yanmanciazhi ma ade kpikpe wuncin'a.

Surah 18:6  ,        Thou wouldst only perchance fret thyself to death following after them in grief if they believe not in this Message.,Kengi'I ga keo na wyoga eti tacinn'o jin hallaka ebo bojin'azhio be yangban yin yan imani na-ajin be Litafi na na yin'a nae.
Surah 18:7    ,      That which is on earth we have made but as a glittering show for the earth in order that We may test them - as to which of them are best in conduct.,Hakika Yia yannazhi kpe eti kinbo kpatana la'afe ninpa yau ebo Yi'I man'a'e cin-y-lezi'I ga lotin wangi gan'o
Surah 18:8 ,    Verily what is on earth we shall make but as dust and dry soil (without growth or herbage),Hakika ma Yi gaa yannazhi kpeti'ubo kpata na la'azhe jikanna nade anfani ndondoa na.
Surah 18:9  ,       Or dost thou reflect that the Companions of the Cave and of the Inscription were wonders among Our Sign,Kashi wyoe kpayekpa gan jamaa yan kpankoro zhi to yan elo zhi afefe dan mini aya Yizhi nazhi yi eyan mamaki nae.
Surah 18:10    ,           Behold the youths betook themselves to the Cave: they said "Our Lord! bestow on us Mercy from Thyself and dispose of our affair for us in the right way!",Kamina egi gbarufu wuncinzhi dawa ecinba dan mini kpankoro na aci gan:"Tsoci yi!

Surah 18:11  ,    Then We draw (a veil) over their ears for a number of years in the Cave (so that they heard not):,Yi cia ekpinlu laadan tukpaazhio dan mini kpankoro (aci fe le le) yan eya nazhi dokun na.
Surah 18:12   ,     Then We roused them in order to test which of the two parties was best at calculating the term of years they had tarried!,Gancin Yicia san ebo Yi deba'y-la'ywu zi'L mini jama'a gubaba nanazhio tswa hakika yan ekpaio yan edunfe zan nazhi (kpankoro bo).

Surah 18:14   ,               We gave strength to their hearts: Behold they stood up and said: "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and of the earth: never shall we call upon any god other than Him: if we did we should indeed have uttered an enormity!,Yi cia yangban'azhi gboka be imaniy kamina a kugikini acigan: "Tsoci yi wyun gayi Tsoci yan sanmazhi to kin yin'o; yia jin bauta ya Tsoci ndoci zunma'u boa kacin'a ngan yi gaazhe ganmana zuncizhi.

Surah 18:16                  "When ye turn away from them and the things they worship other than Allah betake yourselves to the Cave: Your Lord will shower His mercies on you and disposes of your affair towards comfort and ease.",Dagan na ma ye yea gan be ayin to yannazhi'ejin bauta ya na to yea ku ye kan fi mini kpankoro Tsoci'e wyun'a jin bagwo yan yegun'uzhi ya ye Umaa jin shiri yan saukizhi yaye dan mini alamari yezhio.
Surah 18:17   ,                              Thou wouldst have seen the sun when it rose declining to the right from their Cave and when it set turning away from them to the left while they lay in the open space in the midst of the Cave. Such are among the Signs of Allah: He whom Allah guides is rightly guided; but he whom Allah leaves to stray- for him wilt thou find no protector to lead him to the Right Way.,Wyo ma'a le igidi ye kamina ugaa la tinya na ugaa pan ke kpankoroa lugwa lo gwa'a-lo kamina uma ga'ada lo na wun'ajin ufe pan lo kasanta yan gwa'apin ama fi tacin'ubo.

Surah 18:18     ,                Thou wouldst have deemed them awake whilst they were asleep and We turned them on their right and on their left sides: their dog stretching forth his two fore-legs on the threshold: if thou hadst come up on to them thou wouldst have certainly turned back from them in flight and wouldst certainly have been filled with terror of them.,Wyo ma'afe leaye le ke zanazhia san-san zhibo na ala'lima ayi ele-yn-lere; Yima ci fe zhe'aban lo kansanta gwa'alo to kansanta gwa'apin eshigia ma wun'a biciuzhi guba'bau ta zhi yegboro zhenpa yan kpankoro daa wyo ga'ashi ye shi ci cin'ale yagban wyo ma gaa she be dansun-y.
Surah 18:19       ,                              Such (being their state) we raised them up (from sleep) that they might question each other. Said one of them "How long have ye stayed (here)" They said "We have stayed (perhaps) a day or part of a day." (At length) they (all) said "Allah (alone) knows best how long ye have stayed here.... Now send ye then one of you with this money of yours to the town: let him find out which is the best food (to be had) and bring some to you that (ye may) satisfy your hunger therewith: And let him behave with care and courtesy and let him not inform any one about you.,Acinga ga yi be san'ao ebo adebaa gbin dozhi gan (eti ele leabo).

Surah 18:21      ,                         Thus did We make their case known to the people that they might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. Behold they dispute among themselves as to their affair. (Some) said "Construct a building over them": Their Lord knows best about them: those who prevailed over their affair said "Let us surely build a place of worship over them.",Acinga ga ma Soko be la'a wu zawangizhio ebo adebaa kpeawo kede hakika alkawali Soko gaskiya uyio na Alkiyami ma kelokezhin ndondo danboa.

Surah 18:45 ,                     Set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world: It is like the rain which we send down from the skies: the earth´s vegetation absorbs it but soon it becomes dry stubble which the winds do scatter: it is (only) Allah who prevails over all things.,Wyo mao ya'a kotonci yan edunfe izhe (kendoe uyi na) ke nuwan na uyio na Yi duzhin dagan sanmao na gancin yandzo yan kin zhi cia bokeba beuyin gancin uci bea wo kpakparae efezhi cie ku'uza (kendoe bauna).

Surah 18:55       ,           And what is there to keep back men from believing now that Guidance has come to them nor from praying for forgiveness from their Lord but that (they ask that) the ways of the ancients be repeated with them or the Wrath be brought to them face to face,Amade yandoci na kan zawangizhi imani-y-jin kamina bawu be yaa na'a acia kezhea ba gafara be Tsocia yin naa saide eyetu yan (azaba) iri na be ya za mafarizhi na koma azaba iri-iri naa be ya'a na.
Surah 18:56    ,             We only send the messengers to give Glad Tidings and to give warnings: But the unbelievers dispute with vain argument in order therewith to weaken the truth and they treat My Signs as a jest as also the fact that they are warned!,Yi mae tun Tucizhi tun be bea saide ebo alaafe zanazhie ya labari yangbanfa na amaa laafe zanazhie na-wun na.
