Surah 17:8,          It may be that your Lord may (yet) show Mercy unto you; but if ye revert (to your sins) We shall revert (to Our punishments): And we have made Hell a prison for those who reject (all Faith).,Kengi uyio na Tsociye wyun'a gun ye ye nao.

Surah 17:12  ,                    We have made the Night and the Day as two (of Our) Signs: the Sign of the Night have We obscured while the Sign of the Day We have made to enlighten you; that ye may seek bounty from your Lord and that ye may know the number and count of the years: all things have We explained in detail.,Yimaa yeshi to batin la'azhe aya guba; yicia aya yeshi laazhe (zhiko shi) yicia aya yan batin laazhe haske ebo yedebae wa bagwo dagan eba Tsoci yebo ebo ma ye kpe lisafi eyezhie ye be lisafi eyanbazhi.

Surah 17:15  ,                  Who receiveth guidance receiveth it for his own benefit: who goeth astray doth so to his own loss: No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another: nor would We visit with Our Wrath until We had sent an messenger (to give warning).,Zana gaa ke eko na to uke eko ke ya ti tacin'u zana ma gaa gbin na u gbin gbin ya tiu.

Surah 17:16 ,            When We decide to destroy a population We (first) send a definite order to those among them who are given the good things of this life and yet transgress; so that the word is proved true against them: then (it is) We destroy them utterly.,Yi ma ga'a kpa gan yiajin alkarya ndoci hallaka yiajin yijin (za koazhi) wancin yan'azhi foro (be tun guru lo'e) acigaa leba (afe lotun dedezhi fikinbo) gancin hukunci azaba ciga'ajin tabbata ta etiabo yi ci gaajin hallaka baenio.

Surah 17:18    ,             If any do wish for the transitory things (of this life) We readily grant them - such things as We will to such person as We will: in the end have We provided Hell for them: they will burn therein disgraced and rejected.,Zana gaa fe gan izhe nae fanynzona wyun'e wao na zana ga ba yi (miniabo na) yia dinye la yanna ga ba yina yau gancin Yici ga jahannama la'a yau wyun'a gangandonbo eza tiabi za na a yan ke rahma Soko lugwa na.
Surah 17:19   ,        Those who do wish for the (things of) the Hereafter and strive therefor with all due striving and have Faith- they are the ones whose striving is acceptable (to Allah).,Zana ma wyun'ayi egagba wangi yan Alkiyami wyun'e wao na uma ci lo tun iri wuncin na uma imani jin na to za wuncinzhi etun'azhi ga'afe etun gwigwoci nama (Soko)'a jin yebo ya'a na.

Surah 17:33 ,                    Nor take life - which Allah has made sacred - except for just cause. And if anyone is slain wrongfully we have given his heir authority (to demand qisas or to forgive): but let him not exceed bounds in the matter of taking life; for he is helped (by the Law).,Ye mae ga wu rayi na Sokoa la jin haramu na ma sai de be hakkiu yin zandondo nama aga wu eti zwaluncio na hakika yi-yia kagbo la'a ya egun-giciuzhi (yan jin-jin ga) amaa aga -- iyaka gan eba wuwu-gao ma.

Surah 17:39     ,            These are among the (precepts of) wisdom which thy Lord has revealed to thee.

Surah 17:44  ,                  The seven heavens and the earth and all beings therein declare His glory: there is not a thing but celebrates His praise; And yet ye understand not how they declare His glory! Verily He is Oft-Forbear Most Forgiving!,Sanma gutwaba (kpata) to kinzhi to yannazhi fi kinbo kpata na e li Soko tsatsa yin.

Surah 17:46  ,                And We put coverings over their hearts (and minds) lest they should understand the Qur´an and deafness into their ears: when thou dost commemorate thy Lord and Him alone in the Qur´an they turn on their backs fleeing (from the Truth).,Yicia kpere ndoci laakpea yangba'o ebo ma aga deba jin fahimta Alkuranu ma yimae la ekpinlu ndoci la'agun'a tukpa'azhio.

Surah 17:55      ,        And it is your Lord that knoweth best all beings that are in the heavens and on earth: We did bestow on some prophets more (and other) gifts than on others: and We gave to David (the gift of) the Psalms.,Tsoci wyoe ga ma kpe gan'o be iri alitta nazhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo na.

Surah 17:57    ,             Those whom they call upon do desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord - even those who are nearest: they hope for His Mercy and fear His Wrath: for the Wrath of thy Lord is something to take heed of.,Zawuncinzhi nazhi kafiri zhie ba yan be yin na atsoe wa ekpa wa na agade tsonba Tsoci gan na zi maade tsonba Soko gan'o Amaejin kauna yegun Soko amae sundan azabau hakika azaba Tsoci wyoe eyan dansun uyio.

Surah 17:59  ,                  And We refrain from sending the signs only because the men of former generations treated them as false: We sent the she-camel to the Thamud to open their eyes but they treated her wrongfully: We only send the Signs by way of terror (and warning from evil).,Yandoci ma kan yi ci tun ayazhi fiye yin'a yan'a sai de ebo na za mafari nazhi ala tunza fi na u'uyi ganmana na yi ma la rakum ya Samuduzhi nae wu gbangba yan zankpe Soko na acia eti tacin'a jin gun beu yin yi ma e la ayazhi wua sai de ebo danlio.
Surah 17:60         ,               Behold!
