Surah 5:2  ,                                                O ye who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah nor of the sacred month nor of the animals brought for sacrifice nor the garlands that mark out such animals nor the people resorting to the sacred house seeking of the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord. But when ye are clear of the sacred precincts and of pilgrim garb ye may hunt and let not the hatred of some people in (once) shutting you out of the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help ye one another in righteousness and piety but help ye not one another in sin and rancour: fear Allah: for Allah is strict in punishment,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega kara gigwafi ekpo yan ibada Soko zhi saya ma ye mae ga sa alfurma yan etswa alfurma ya ma to hadaya (dabba naezun etun hajio na) to yannazhi aga lagwo dabba yan hadayazhi na to za nazhie kpa ziyara kata alfurma acie wa falala yan tsocia za gannibe yardau yin na ma.

Surah 5:3     ,                                                       Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat blood the flesh of swine and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah; that which hath been killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a headlong fall or by being gored to death; that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form); that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrows: that is impiety. This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you completed My favour upon you and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. But if any is forced by hunger with no inclination to transgression Allah is indeed Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,A eyan tsutsuci la'ajin haramu ya ye to egya to nakan kpu'utsun to eyan zunzunci na'atun sunna yandoci ye ta eti'ubo na'jin yan Soko'a na to dabba na'atswanni ci wu'una to na'awu be kagboe na to na pinzhin kin dagan fitio cia tsu na to na'atun yan cia tsuna to na yankungizhi sa gi na sai de na yetso ga zun na.

Surah 5:4  ,                            They ask thee what is lawful to them (as food). Say: lawful unto you are (all) things good and pure: and what ye have taught your trained hunting animals (to catch) in the manner directed to you by Allah: eat what they catch for you but pronounce the name of Allah over it: and fear Allah; for Allah is swift in taking account,E' gbin wyo gan gan kizhi alajin halali ya a yao Gan gan: "A" yannazhi yi lilici na la'ajin halali yaye.

Surah 5:5  ,                                        This day are (all) things good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers but chaste women among the People of the Book revealed before your time- when ye give them their due dowers and desire chastity not lewdness nor secret intrigues if any one rejects faith fruitless is his work and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good),Yinna a yangici lilicizhi la'azhe halali yaye to yangici yan za nazhi ala litafi ya na halali uyio yaye yangici yetso ma halali uyi ya'ao.

If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill or on a journey or one of you cometh from offices of nature or ye have been in contact with women and ye find no water then take for yourselves clean sand or earth and rub therewith your faces and hands Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty but to make you clean and to complete his favour to you that ye may be grateful,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:7,                  And call in remembrance the favour of Allah unto you and His covenant which He ratified with you when ye said: "We hear and we obey": And fear Allah for Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts,Ye mae pa ni'ima Soko na ta eti yebo na to alkawaliU natso wyun'a fin ye keba be yin na kamina ye gan; "Yi wo yima emi tu".

Surah 5:8,                         O ye who believe! stand out firmly for Allah as witnesses to fair dealing and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear Allah. For Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Yea kugikini be kagboe ebo Soko ye laefe eri jincizhi be adalinciy.

Surah 5:10,      Those who reject faith and deny our signs will be companions of Hell-fire,Za nazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na acia aya yi yi ganmana na za wuncinzhi gayi masoyi ena zhio.
Surah 5:11 ,                     O ye who believe! Call in remembrance the favour of Allah unto you when certain men formed the design to stretch out their hands against you but (Allah) held back their hands from you: so fear Allah. And on Allah let believers put (all) their trust,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:12  ,                                          Allah did aforetime take a covenant from the Children of Israel and we appointed twelve captains among them. And Allah said: "I am with you: if ye (but) establish regular prayers practise regular charity believe in my messengers honour and assist them and loan to Allah a beautiful loan verily I will wipe out from you your evils and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing beneath; but if any of you after this resisteth faith he hath truly wandered from the path or rectitude.",Akika Soko ma la alkawali be Banu Isra'ila zhiy Yi ci li nunsa guwo be gubae dagan miniabo Soko ci gan: Akika mi midan ganni be ye yin yega swalla kugikini nayecia zakka dukiya yezhi wa na yecia imani jin be Tuci mizhiy ye ci jin'a taimako yeci man Soko eyan wangi akika miga etun dede yezhi finya yaye akika Mi ma ga ye la'agandan Aljannazhio nazhi nuwan eduzhie je' fi takoabo na gancin zana gabeajin kafirinci miniebo baci wuncio na akika za wuncin'a gbin ke eko gboro lugwa.
Surah 5:13 ,                              But because of their breach of their covenant We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard; they change the words from their (right) places and forget a good part of the message that was sent them nor wilt thou cease to find them- barring a few - ever bent on (new) deceits: but forgive them and overlook (their misdeeds): for Allah loveth those who are kind,To ebo alkawaliazhi nazhi a lo ya na Yi yia emi bo kpea yicia yangban'azhi la'azhe wiwoci kpakparae acie zhe egan zhi'gba ke danna'azhi lugwa acia eyankozhi nazhia san'atu na batan wyo ma'ala ke yaboa wyo afe taye le hainci (eta) ye dagan eba'abo saide zadegi miniabo (tsa wa kao).

Surah 5:14,                        From those too who call themselves Christians We did take a covenant but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them: so we estranged them with enmity and hatred between the one and the other to the day of judgment. And soon will Allah show them what it is they have done,Yima ke la alkawali dagan eba zanazhi gan: "Yi de akika Nasara yiyio na acia eyanko ndoci batan mini yannazhi a san'atu beyin na.

Surah 5:17,                                         In blasphemy indeed are those that say that Allah is Christ the son of Mary. Say: "Who then hath the least power against Allah if His will were to destroy Christ the son of Mary his mother and all every - one that is on the earth For to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between.

Say: "Why then doth He punish you for your sins Nay ye are but men- of the men he hath created: He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and He punisheth whom He pleaseth: and to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between: and unto Him is the final goal (of all)",Yahuduzhi to Nasarazhi gan: "Yi ga yi egi Soko zhi to masoyiuzhio".

Now hath come unto you making (things) clear unto you Our Messenger after the break in (the series of) our messengers lest ye should say: "There came unto us no bringer of glad tidings and no warner (from evil)": But now hath come unto you a bringer of glad tidings and a warner (from evil).

Surah 5:20   ,                  Remember Moses said to his people: "O my people! Call in remembrance the favour of Allah unto you when He produced prophets among you made you kings and gave you what He had not given to any other among the peoples,To kamina Musa gangan be jama'a yan'uzhi na: Ya ye jama'a yan mizhi efe pa ni'ima Soko na ta eti yebo na Ula Annabizhi tinya mini yebo uma ye la'agi etsuzhi uma ya ye yanna ula ya zandondo mini alitazhi boa na.

Egandan kin nayi danna lilici na na Soko a ka shidzo yayena ye mae ga ya zuma ma ebo ye bea zhegba yeazhe eza asarazhi ma.

Surah 5:23 ,                   (But) among (their) Allah-fearing men were two on whom Allah had bestowed His grace: They said: "Assault them at the (proper) Gate: when once ye are in victory will be yours; But on Allah put your trust if ye have faith.",Eza bagi guba mini za nazhie sundan Soko na nazhi Soko twa'arya be ni'imae na a gan: E gan fia dagan eko misun'o ebona ye ga'gandan akika yega'ade zankpe ta etiabo.

Surah 5:27  ,                     Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one but not from the other. Said the latter: "Be sure I will slay thee." "Surely" said the former "Allah doth accept of the sacrifice of those who are righteous,Wyo mao gba labari yan egi guba yan Adamuo ya'a be gaskiyae lokaci na a zun dabba za guba'ba acia yan zaeni gwo ama gwo yan zaba cia.

Surah 5:28 ,              "If thou dost stretch thy hand against me to slay me it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee: for I do fear Allah the cherisher of the worlds,Akika ka wyo ga ta egwa wye be eba mi ebo wyo la mi yan'o wu mi fe zana'a tagwa be eba wyoe ebo min'la wyo yin wu na'a.

Surah 5:30 ,       The (selfish) soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother: he murdered him and became (himself) one of the lost ones.Ucia sa fiu yan gban'o na uga yegi'uwu na uma ciu'wu ga gan cin ucia tinba wyun'afe dan mini eza hasarazhio.
Surah 5:31,                        Then Allah sent a raven who scratched the ground to show him how to hide the shame of his brother. "Woe is me!" said he; "Was I not even able to be as this raven and to hide the shame of my brother" then he became full of regrets,Soko cia kwankwa ndoci tun tun uci fe da gba kin ebo ulau'wu'u kendoe uga swo ekun yegiu swona.

Surah 5:32,                                       On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs yet even after that many of them continued to commit excesses in the land,Ebo dalili wuncin'o Yiciu la jin wajibi ta eti Bani Israilazhio kede akika zandondo na ga rayi wu na Uma yi be hakki yan rayi ndocia na koma eyan nyin kpe eti kinboa na to le fi za wuncin uyi ke yan za na'a zawangizhi kpata ku wu na za na maga rayi nini dan rayi na la'adau yi ke za na;a zawangizhi kpata dan rayi na Akika ma Tuci Yizhi be ya;a be bayanizhi gancin akika kundondo miniabo baci wuncin'o afe za nazhi nyin yan kpe eti kinbo na.
Surah 5:33,                                 The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution or crucifixion or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter,Akika egagba yan za nazhie gun kun be Sokoe to be Tunci Uyin na acie lotun fikinbo eti eyan nyin'o na (gara da) uga yi ala'a wu ko ma ala'afosa koma ala egwa'zhi to biciazhi'a ko'aya eti cice leba dozhio koma ala'a nyan dagan kinbo.Wuncin zun yesun uyi ya'ao dan mini izheo azaba na ma wancin na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a dan emi zobao.

Surah 5:35 ,           O ye who believe! Do your duty to Allah seek the means of approach unto Him and strive with might and main in his cause: that ye may prosper,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Esundan Soko 'ye mae wa ekpa na yega'de tsonba lobau na yemaefe'jin jihadi (kokari) ta eti eko Soko (ujin wo) be wuncin'y ye ga'de robo (yan izhe to Alkiyami).
Surah 5:36 ,                      As to those who reject Faith- if they had everything on earth and twice repeated to give as ransom for the penalty of the Day of Judgment it would never be accepted of them theirs would be a grievous penalty,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci na da'aci gan yannazhi fi kinbo kpata na aga wun'o to ndoci dozhin'ube ebo ala'asa etia dagan azaba Efo Alkiyamiy a gwo egwa'aboa azaba nama tan saranyinna ga'jin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 5:37,           Their wish will be to get out of the Fire but never will they get out therefrom: their penalty will be one that endures.,E'wa gan' ala'adzun'a tin'aya dagan mini enao ama jin za nazhia dzun tinya bo na'a azaba na tsoa fedun na wun'a jin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 5:38,            As to the thief Male or female cut off his or her hands: a punishment by way of example from Allah for their crime: and Allah is Exalted in power,To igbeci bagi to igbeci yinzagi yea egwa'azhi gubaba ko ya egagba uyio yan woce na 'ace nao azaba yan ewunna uyio dagan eba Soko. Soko ma Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 5:39 ,            But if the thief repents after his crime and amends his conduct Allah turneth to him in forgiveness; for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Zandondo na ga tuba jin na baci yan zwalunci na ujin na uci kezhea haliu tadzu na akika Soko Etsu ga'fara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 5:40  ,                Knowest thou not that to Allah (alone) belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth He punisheth whom He pleaseth and He forgiveth whom He pleaseth: and Allah hath power over all things,Kashi wyo kpe kpe gan akika Soko ga wun mulki samazhi to kin yin'o wyun'ejin za na ga ba una azaba Soko ma de kagbo ta eti yandondo'.
Surah 5:41  ,                                                                O Messenger! let not those grieve thee who race each other into unbelief: (whether it be) among those who say "We believe" with their lips but whose hearts have no faith; or it be among the Jews- men who will listen to any lie- will listen even to others who have never so much as come to thee. They change the words from their (right) times and places: they say "If ye are given this take it but if not beware!" If any one´s trial is intended by Allah thou hast no authority in the least for him against Allah. For such - it is not Allah´s will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment,Ya wyoe Tuci!

Surah 5:42 ,                        (They are fond of) listening to falsehood of devouring anything forbidden. If they do come to thee either judge between them or decline to interfere. If thou decline they cannot hurt thee in the least. If thou judge judge in equity between them. For Allah loveth those who judge in equity,Ezazhi ayio nazhie dokun be tukpshiy ya ganmana na amae dokun be gi gi haramuy ebo acin'o aga be eba wyoe jin hukunci tsakaniabo ko ma wyo dzun gan'abo. Wyo ma ga'a dzun gan'abo ala egun ndondo tso wyoe woa wyo ma ga'ajin hukunci to jin hukunci tsakaniabo be adalinciy. Akika Soko wyun'e wa za nazhi gae jin adalinci na.
Surah 5:43,              But why do they come to thee for decision when they have (their own) law before them- therein is the (plain) command of Allah; yet even after that they would turn away. For they are not (really) People of Faith,Ki ma la acie be ba wyoe eti hukunci bo ala'li ma litafi' Attaura danbeayin miniubo ma hukunci Soko danbo ganci acie la zunma zheta ba'aci yan bayani wuncin 'bo Za wuncinzhi nazhie jin aninga na ajin muminizhia.
Surah 5:44,                                        It was We who revealed the law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews by the prophets who bowed (as in Islam) to Allah´s will by the rabbis and the doctors of law: for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah´s book and they were witnesses thereto: therefore fear not men but fear me and sell not my signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed they are (no better than) Unbelievers,Akika yicin litafi Attaura miniubo mabawu danbo to haske Annabizhi nazhia kpatsun ta ya foro Soko baenio na e laujinhukunci ya yahuduzhi to man nazhie wuzazhi ba lo eba Soko na to man kpikpezhi be iri yanna awa bea yin yan tswitswa litafi Soko na atsoma;afe eri yacizhi eti wuncin'o.

Surah 5:45,                              We ordained therein for them: "Life for life eye for eye nose or nose ear for ear tooth for tooth and wounds equal for equal." But if any one remits the retaliation by way of charity it is an act of atonement for himself. And if any fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed they are (No better than) wrong-doers,Yi ma hukunci jin tiile ta eti abo dan miniubo kede ala rayia wu na wyuntso ga rayi wuna ala eya za'awa wyuntso ga wa za eye na to eye be eye to tukpa be tukpae to yikan be yikan'e to eba eba yinzhio egagba yan jinjinga ga wunayio.

Surah 5:46  ,                       And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary confirming the Law that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah,Yicia dida la'adan eti eta'azhio be Isah egi Maryamuy wyun'e ya gaskiya be yanna be shiudzo dagan mini Attaurao na yi ma litafi Injeela la'a yau miniubo bawu danbo to haske wyuntso mae ya gaskiya be yan na beshidzo dagan mini Attaurao na Uma yi bawu be wa'aziy ya za nazhi gae sundan Soko na.
Surah 5:47,               Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed they are (no better than) those who rebel,To jama'a yan litafi Injeeluzhi ajin hukunci be yanna Soko cin be fi bo na. Zandondo na maejin hukunci be yanna Soko cin be yin'a na to za wuncinzhi agayi fasikizhio.
Surah 5:48  ,                                                To thee We sent the Scripture in truth confirming the scripture that came before it and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed and follow not their vain desires diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If Allah had so willed He would have made you a single people but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute,Yi ma litafi cin bea ya wyoe be gaskiyae na mae ya gaskiya be yanna zhi be shiudzo dagan mini litafio na na ma kezhe afe etswa ta eti abo na.

Surah 5:50,         Do they then seek after a judgment of (the days of) ignorance But who for a people whose faith is assured can give better judgment than Allah,Kashi hukunci yan jahilizhi (nazhi kpe Soko yea na) wyun ga e'wa zao Zi'I ma danbo na'ajin bolo gan eba hukunci jin'o na'agan Soko nao ya za nazhi imaniazhi agboka nao.
Surah 5:51 ,                    O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors: They are but friends and protectors to each other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them. Verily Allah guideth not a people unjust,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la yahuduzhi to Nasarazhi eya mancizhi ma. Sashiazhi eya mancizhi ayio ya sashio. Zandondo na magae la'a eyamanci mini ebo na to akika wyun tso afe dan mini abo. Aakika Sokoe la-jama'a yan azwalumizhi ke eko wangia.
Surah 5:52  ,                         Those in whose hearts is a disease - thou seest how eagerly they run about amongst them saying: "We do fear lest a change of fortune bring us disaster." Ah! perhaps Allah will give (thee) victory or a decision according to His will. Then will they repent of the thoughts which they secretly harboured in their hearts.,Wyo a le za nazhi batan fi yangban'azhio na ye e'dinye da lo dan miniabo acie gan gan: Yi e'sundan ebo masiba ndoci be tswan yi ma. "To kengi uyio na Sokoa la eko kpe ndoci beyn koma foro ndoci dagan nko Ubo gancin acia bea fe za nazhi eti ro-- nkpe na eti eyan (dede) nazhi afe swofi yangban'azhio na.
Surah 5:53  ,            And those who believe will say: "Are these the men who swore their strongest oaths by Allah that they were with you" All that they do will be in vain and they will fall into (nothing but) ruin,Za nazhi ma'aimani jin na cie gan gan: Ngba zanazhi ga zhikuti be Sokoe har da iyaka kutizhiazhi kede akika be ye yin adan'o nao Etun'azhi a gbin ya acia fe eza hasarazhi.
Surah 5:54 ,                                   O ye who believe! if any from among you turn back from his Faith soon will Allah produce a people whom He will love as they will love Him- lowly with the believers mighty against the rejecters fighting in the way of Allah and never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault. That is the grace of Allah which He will bestow on whom He pleaseth. And Allah encompasseth all and He knoweth all things,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Zaeni ndondo na ga ridda jin cia adiniu nyin ya miniebo na to Soko otso' a la zandocizhi be tinya Soko a yeboaatso maafe yebo Soko a fe dakpya ya muminizhi ama'afe wu zankpe ta eti kafirizhio.

Surah 5:55,            Your (real) friends are (no less than) Allah His Messenger and the (fellowship of) believers- those who establish regular prayers and regular charity and they bow down humbly (in worship),Akika Ndakatako ye nayi eyamanciko ye na Ugayi Soko to Tuciu to zanazhia imani jin nao za nazhie ku swallah gikini na amae wa zakka na amae dokun be lulo yan ruku'-na.
Surah 5:56 ,         As to those who turn (for friendship) to Allah His Messenger and the (fellowship of) believers- it is the fellowship of Allah that must certainly triumph,Zandondo na ga Soko la Ndakatako nayi eyamanciko na to Tuciu to zanazhia imani jin na to akika jama'a yan Soko zhi aga wun zankpeo.
Surah 5:57,                      O ye who believe! take not for friends and protectors those who take your religion for a mockery or sport- whether among those who received the Scripture before you or among those who reject Faith; but fear ye Allah if ye have faith (indeed),Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la za nazhie la adini ye'mi acie la'u dzodzo dagan mini zaba litafizhi nazhi shiye dzo na to kafirizhi masoyizhi ma. Ye mae sundan Soko wun'ayi muminizhi ga ye yio na.
Surah 5:58 ,          When ye proclaim your call to prayer they take it (but) as mockery and sport; that is because they are a people without understanding,Kamina Ye gae yi zazhi lo jin jin swalla na u la eyan emila be edzoe. Wuncin ma yi ebo na afe zanazhi de ankalia na.
Surah 5:59  ,                 Say: "O people of the Book! Do ye disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah and the revelation that hath come to us and that which came before (us) and (perhaps) that most of you are rebellious and disobedient",Gan gan: ya ye za ba litafizhi!

Surah 5:60   ,                       Say: "Shall I point out to you something much worse than this (as judged) by the treatment it received from Allah those who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine those who worshipped evil;- these are (many times) worse in rank and far more astray from the even path!",Gan gan: Ngba min ya ye labari yan yandoci na tso biye gan wuncin ega gbao eba Soko na Uga yi za na Soko u bo'mi ucia zhe wun beu yin nao ucia ndocizhi miniabo la'azhe ebegizhi tokpu'utsun zhi to nazhi wun tagutu (eyandedezhi) na.

Surah 5:61  ,             When they come to thee they say: "We believe": but in fact they enter with a mind against Faith and they go out with the same but Allah knoweth fully all that they hide,Agan-gan-dan be kafirinciy atso ma de kpi kpi gan eti yan nazhi afe-swo na.
Surah 5:62   ,         Many of them dost thou see racing each other in sin and rancour and their eating of things forbidden. Evil indeed are the things that they do,Wyo ma'ale kun-dondo miniabo ye afe san nin dan mini etun le'fio be gbin gbintu iyaka Sokoe to gigi azhi yan yangici haramuzhio. Akika bibi be gwosun'y ajin tabbata ya etun nazhie lo na.
Surah 5:63,            Why do not the rabbis and the doctors of Law forbid them from their (habit of) uttering sinful words and eating things forbidden Evil indeed are their works,Ki'l la man yan Soko ye kpezhi to man wancikozhi ci kan'a egan le fizhi to gi gi yan haramua yin'o Akika bibi be gwosun'y wun'a jin tabbata ya etun nazhi a fe lo na.
Surah 5:64    ,                                          The Jews say: "Allah´s hand is tied up." Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the (blasphemy) they utter. Nay both His hands are widely outstretched: He giveth and spendeth (of His bounty) as He pleaseth. But the revelation that cometh to thee from Allah increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. Amongst them we have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war Allah doth extinguish it; but they (ever) strive to do mischief on earth. And Allah loveth not those who do mischief,Yahuduzhi ma gan: Egwa Soko a wan gwo. (u twarya wo bea ) A egwa'atso wanpa gwo kuruo ama'a bo'mi ebo egan (dede) na' agan na. A'a ujin acin'a egau guba ba kpikpeci ayio titacima'ayio gubaba' wyun'e la'aaya alittazhi kendoe ga bau na.

Surah 5:65 ,          If only the People of the Book had believed and been righteous We should indeed have blotted out their iniquities and admitted them to gardens of bliss,Da' aci gan akika zaba litafizhi a imani jinjin aci sundan Soko da yi ga etun dedeazhi pa ya ya da yi ma ga'a lagandan Aljannazhio nazhi yi emi ni' ima na.
Surah 5:66 ,                      If only they had stood fast by the Law the Gospel and all the revelation that was sent to them from their Lord they would have enjoyed happiness from every side. There is from among them a party on the right course: but many of them follow a course that is evil,Da' aci gan a litafi Attaura to Injeela ku ku gikini to litafi ndoci na'acin be ya'a dagan eba Tsoci abo na da'a Soko maa fe ya'a yangici dagan fititiabo to dagan tako bicita'abo.

Surah 5:67   ,                    O Messenger! proclaim the (message) which hath been sent to thee from thy Lord. If thou didst not thou wouldst not have fulfilled and proclaimed His mission. And Allah will defend thee from men (who mean mischief). For Allah guideth not those who reject Faith,Ya wyoe Tuci! A wyan wu yan yanna acin be ya wyoe dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo na. kagan wyo ma jin acin'a to wyo wuyan etun na'atun wyo na'a dan'o na. Akika Sokoe la jama'a yan kafirizhi ke eko gunua.
Surah 5:68 ,                            Say: "O People of the Book! ye have no ground to stand upon unless ye stand fast by the Law the Gospel and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord." It is the revelation that cometh to thee from thy Lord that increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. But sorrow thou not over (these) people without Faith,Gan gan: "Ya ye zaba litafizhi!

Surah 5:69,                   Those who believe (in the Qur´an) those who follow the Jewish (scriptures) and the Sabians and the Christians- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day and work righteousness- on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve,Akika za nazhi imani jin nato za nazhi ga tuba jin mini yahuduzhio na to swabiuzhi(za nazhia pan ke eko lugwa na) to Nasarazhi ndondo na ga imani jin be Sokoe na to be Efo Alkiyami na uci kezhe lo tun wangi na to dansun danbo ya'a to yangban yin ndondo ma danbo ya'a.
Surah 5:70,                  We took the covenant of the Children of Israel and sent them messengers every time there came to them a messenger with what they themselves desired not - some (of these) they called impostors and some they (go so far as to) slay,Akika yi la alkawali br Bani Israilazhiyi ma tun Tucizhi fia kandondo na Tuci ga be ya'a be yan nazhi ba yangban'azhia na sashizhi u yi ganmana sashi ndoci ma a fe wu Tucizhi.
Surah 5:71 ,                 They thought there would be no trial (or punishment); so they became blind and deaf; yet Allah (in mercy) turned to them; yet again many of them became blind and deaf. But Allah sees well all that they do,Aci fe kpaye gan fitina ndondoa na'a gancin acia na ye a ma'a te tukpa gancin Soko ci fa bea yin gancin ekundondoazhi ci kezhea na 'ye acia te tukpa Soko mae cin'a le be iri etu nazhi e'lo na.
Surah 5:72   ,                             They do blaspheme who say: "Allah is Christ the son of Mary." But said Christ: "O Children of Israel! worship Allah my Lord and your Lord." Whoever joins other gods with Allah- Allah will forbid him the garden and the Fire will be his abode. There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help,Akika za nazhiga gan gan: "Akika Masihu egi Maryama gayi Soko na a jin kafirinci Masihu ma gan: "Ya ye Bani Israilazhie jin bauta ya Soko na yi Tsoci mi to Tsoci ye na.

Whoever joins other gods with Allah- Allah will forbid him the garden and the Fire will be his abode. There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help.Akika za nazhiga gan gan: ",Akika Masihu egi Maryama gayi Soko na a jin kafirinci Masihu ma gan: "Ya ye Bani Israilazhie jin bauta ya Soko na yi Tsoci mi to Tsoci ye na.

Surah 5:73    ,                    They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity: for there is no god except One Allah. If they desist not from their word (of blasphemy) verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them,Akika za nazhi gan gan: Akika Soko za taci yan guta u yio' na a jin kafirinci ama de Tsoci ndocia sai de Tsoci nini ke'tekagan ma akegan be yannaegan na yan'a akika azaba na tan na ga'a two za nazhia jin kafirinci miniabo.
Surah 5:74 ,      Why turn they not to Allah and seek His forgiveness For Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Kashi a ga tuba jin lo eba Sokoa ama'a ba gafara be U yin'a; alali ma Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uma yio.
Surah 5:74,       Why turn they not to Allah and seek His forgiveness For Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.Kashi a ga tuba jin lo eba Sokoa ama'a ba gafara be U yin'a; alali ma Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uma yio.
Surah 5:75,                        Christ the son of Mary was no more than a messenger; many were the messengers that passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They had both to eat their (daily) food. See how Allah doth make His signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth!,Masihu egi Maryama ufea sai de Tuci kawanyi Akika Tucizhima a be shiu dzoani nnau ma eza gaskiya uyio.

Surah 5:77   ,                   Say: "O people of the Book! exceed not in your religion the bounds (of what is proper) trespassing beyond the truth nor follow the vain desires of people who went wrong in times gone by- who misled many and strayed (themselves) from the even way.,Gan gan: Ya ye zaba litafizhi!

Surah 5:78  ,              Curses were pronounced on those among the Children of Israel who rejected Faith by the tongue of David and of Jesus the son of Mary: because they disobeyed and persisted in excesses,A emibo kpe za nazhia jin kafirinci mini bani Israilazhio na be gintara Dawuda to Isa egi Maryamae. Wuncin ma ma yi ebo le'fia boamaafe za na zhie gbin iyaka tu na.
Surah 5:79  ,       Nor did they (usually) forbid one another the iniquities which they committed: evil indeed were the deeds which they did,Afe e kan etun dede nazhie lo na'a. Akika etun nazhi afe lo na wun'a bi ye.
Surah 5:79 ,        Nor did they (usually) forbid one another the iniquities which they committed: evil indeed were the deeds which they did,Afe e kan etun dede nazhie lo na'a. Akika etun nazhi afe lo na wun'a bi ye.
Surah 5:80,                  Thou seest many of them turning in friendship to the Unbelievers. Evil indeed are (the works) which their souls have sent forward before them (with the result) that Allah´s wrath is on them and in torment will they abide,Wyoa le ekundondo miniabo ye akafirizhi la masoyizhi. Akika yanna ala shidzo ya eti ta'cin'a na wun'a bi ye ebo na Sokoa zhe wun bea yin ama'afi mini azabao tutun yin.
Surah 5:81 ,             If only they had believed in Allah in the Prophet and in what hath been revealed to him never would they have taken them for friends and protectors but most of them are rebellious wrong-doers,Da aci gan afe za nazhia imani jin be Sokoe to be Annabiy to yan na acin be yau na da a'la kafirizhi masoyizhia. Amma'ade ekundondo miniabo fasikizhi ayio.
Surah 5:82,                         Strongest among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the Jews and Pagans; and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say "We are Christians": because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world and they are not arrogant,Akika wyoa tsun za nazhi gboka gan eba nanvo yaza nazhia imani jin na a ga yi Yahuduzhio to za nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na.

Surah 5:83,                    And when they listen to the revelation received by the Messenger thou wilt see their eyes overflowing with tears for they recognise the truth: they pray: "Our Lord! we believe; write us down among the witnesses,Kamina aga wo yanna'acin be ya Tuci na wyo a le eyeazhi ye wun'e je egiye ebo kpikpe nazhi ade yan gaskiya na acie gan gan: "Tuci yi! yi yia gaskiya ya ebo acin'o a yi kadan mini eri jincizhio.
Surah 5:84 ,              "What cause can we have not to believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us seeing that we long for our Lord to admit us to the company of the righteous",Ki'ma dan be yi yin'o har na yi yia jin imani be Soko yin'a na yin'o to yanna be yayi yan gaskiyae naa yin'o Yi mae bavun gan Tsoci yi u la yi'u gan'udan (Aljannao) gan ni be za guruzhiy.
Surah 5:85,             And for this their prayer hath Allah rewarded them with gardens with rivers flowing underneath- their eternal home. Such is the recompense of those who do good,Ebo acin'o Soko ci ga'a gba ebo egan na'aagan na be Aljannazhi nazhi nuwanzhie je fi takoabo na ama'fi bo fi tutun yin. Wuncin ga mayi egagba yan za nazhie jin bolobolo nao.
Surah 5:86,      But those who reject Faith and belie our Signs- they shall be companions of Hell-fire,Zanazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na acia aya Yi zhi yi ganmana na za wuncinzhi ga yi eyamancizhi yan ena jahimao.
Surah 5:87,                O ye who believe! make not unlawful the good things which Allah hath made lawful for you but commit no excess: for Allah loveth not those given to excess,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la eyan managizhi na Soko la'jin halali ya ye na haramu ma ye mae ga gwo iyaka ganma. Akika Sokoe wa za nazhie gwo iyaka gan na'a.
Surah 5:88,           Eat of the things which Allah hath provided for you lawful and good; but fear Allah in Whom ye believe,Ye mae gi dagan arziki na Soko la'ayaye na natso gayi halali uma yi lilici na ye mae sundan Soko na ye gan ye jin imani be yin na.
Surah 5:89,                                            Allah will not call you to account for what is futile in your oaths but He will call you to account for your deliberate oaths: for expiation feed ten indigent persons on a scale of the average for the food of your families; or clothe them; or give a slave his freedom. If that is beyond your means fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths ye have sworn. But keep to your oaths. Thus doth Allah make clear to you His signs that ye may be grateful,Sokoa wan ye yea be kuti nazhi ye dazhi yan' ti kpere na'a amma'ade wyun'a wan ye be yanazhi ye ga ta kpankoro yeci zhi kuti na Ebo acin'o kafara (kutizhi ganmana) uyi yangici la ya ezagwagbagizhi guwo dagan mini yangici tatacin na ye'gi be iyali yezhi na ko ma ye' la tufuwazhie ya'ae' fan koma ye' la wuzhie sa ula'u zhe egi.

Surah 5:90 ,             O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling (dedication of) stones and (divination by) arrows are an abomination- of Satan´s handwork: eschew such (abomination) that ye may prosper,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:91  ,                 Satan´s plan is (but) to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer: will ye not then abstain,Akika shetan de kpa gan wyun'ula ewunsun bedozhi to nanvo dozhi ula'u la'udan tsakani yebo be dozhi dan mini egyeo be cacae umau la ye yeu kan' uke pipa Soko to swalla jin'u lugwa. To ye lugwa gancin'a.
Surah 5:92 ,           Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware (of evil): if ye do turn back know ye that it is Our Messenger´s duty to proclaim (the message) in the clearest manner,Ye mae la mietu Soko ye mae la mietu Tuci (Soko) ye mae tswa minie. Ye ma ga bea zunmazheta to ye kpe'wo kede yan na ta eti Tuci yibo na uga yi eyanwu na'atula nao.
Surah 5:93  ,                     On those who believe and do deeds of righteousness there is no blame for what they ate (in the past) when they guard themselves from evil and believe and do deeds of righteousness- (or) again guard themselves from evil and believe- (or) again guard themselves from evil and do good. For Allah loveth those who do good,Le fi danbo ta eti za nazhiga imani jin aci lo tun wangizhi dan mini yan nazhi aga gi na boa abeke aga'fe za nazhi tswa Soko naa acia imani jin aci lo tun wangizhi na gancin aci kezhe tswa Soko aci jin bolobolozhi na. Soko mae wa za nazhi gae jin bolobolo na.
Surah 5:94,                      O ye who believe! Allah doth but make a trial of you in a little matter of game well within reach of game well within reach of your hands and your lances that He may test who feareth him unseen: any who transgress thereafter will have a grievous penalty,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Akika Soko' amaye cinle be yandoci dagan mini egbe gbeo (Hajio) na egwa yezhi to ekpa yezhi'a wan ya ye na ebo Soko u la'u wu yan za na gae sundan Soko swiswoci na zandondona ma ga bea gbintu baci wuncin'o na to azaba na tan na ga'jin tabbata yau.
Surah 5:95    ,                                             O ye who believe! Kill not game while in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. If any of you doth so intentionally the compensation is an offering brought to the Ka´ba of a domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed as adjudged by two just men among you; or by way of atonement the feeding of the indigent; or its equivalent in fasts: that he may taste of the penalty of his deed. Allah forgives what is past: for repetition Allah will exact from him the penalty. For Allah is Exalted and Lord of Retribution,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:96  ,                 Lawful to you is the pursuit of water-game and its use for food- for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel; but forbidden is the pursuit of land-game;- as long as ye are in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. And fear Allah to Whom ye shall be gathered back.A' egbe yan yankungi edu to yagiciu la'jin halali ya ye ulaufe eyan emawou ya ye to ezan daci yezhi.

Surah 5:97   ,                       Allah made the Ka´ba the Sacred House an asylum of security for men as also the Sacred Months the animals for offerings and the garlands that mark them: That ye may know that Allah hath knowledge of what is in the heavens and on earth and that Allah is well acquainted with all things.,Sokoa ka'aba la'afe kata Alfurma tsunwan yan kukuta yan adini ya zawangizhi to Etswa Alfurma to hadayazhi to hadaya nazhi a la yan -- koro na wuncinzhi ma ebo ye debae kpe'wo kede akika Soko yi be kpikpe yannazhifi sanmazhio na to yan nazhi fi kinbo na akika ma Soko yi be kpikpe yandondoe.Surah 5:98        Know ye that Allah is strict in punishment and that Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.Ye mae kpe wo kede akika Soko Etsu na gbota azaba na bo uyioakika ma Soko Etsu gafara uyio etsu yegun uyio.Surah 5:99          The Messenger´s duty is but to proclaim (the message). But Allah knoweth all that ye reveal and ye conceal.Yan dondo ta eti Tuci boa saide eyan wu Soko ma kpe yan nazhi ye jin tula na to yan nazhie ye jin swiswoci na.
Surah 5:100 ,             Say: "Not equal are things that are bad and things that are good even though the abundance of the bad may dazzle thee; so fear Allah O ye that understand; that (so) ye may prosper.",Gan gan: Eyan dede be eyan wangi aga fe nini'a ka da ekundo yan eyan dede gae ya wyo sha'awa na ebo acin'o e tswa Soko be dansun'uyin ya ye nazhi yi eza ankalizhi na ujin wo be wuncin'y ye ga'de rabo.
Surah 5:101   ,                     O ye who believe! Ask not questions about things which if made plain to you may cause you trouble. But if ye ask about things when the Qur´an is being revealed they will be made plain to you Allah will forgive those: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Forbearing,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:102,        Some people before you did ask such questions and on that account lost their faith.Akika za nazhi shi yedzo na gbingan wuncinzhi leani ganci aci tinba (baci na' ajin bayaniya'a na) a jin kafirinci be hukunci wuncinzhi.
Surah 5:103,                    It was not Allah who instituted (superstitions like those of) a slit-ear she-camel or a she-camel let loose for free pasture or idol sacrifices for twin-births in animals or stallion-camels freed from work: It is blasphemers who invent a lie against Allah; but most of them lack wisdom,Soko la hukunci ndondo cici eti bahiraboa (Rakum yiwo gigi naa kotukpa acie wo ya kuti na) to sa'ibatu (rakum naa lo ya cie la wun kuti na eti wiwa nasarao na) to waswilatu (dabbanae wo ya kuti kamina rakum ga'ama gi ebazhi na) to hamu (rakum eba na'a kpe gwa eti wiwo ya kutio na) amma'de zanazhia jin kafirinci na e tswa ganmana tswa ta Soko ekun dondo ma ade ankalia.
Surah 5:104  ,                     When it is said to them: "Come to what Allah hath revealed; come to the Messenger": They say: "Enough for us are the ways we found our fathers following." what! even though their fathers were void of knowledge and guidance,A ma ga gan'a gan: E da beyn eba yan na Soko cin be na to eba Tuci (Soko) agan: " Yan na yi tsun Yan manciyizhi kpe eti ubona kun yikea ni Ngba!

Surah 5:105,                  O ye who believe! Guard your own souls: If ye follow (right) guidance no hurt can come to you from those who stray. the goal of you all is to Allah: it is He that will show you the truth of all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:106,                                                  O ye who believe! When death approaches any of you (take) witnesses among yourselves when making bequests- two just men of your own (brotherhood) or others from outside if ye are journeying through the earth and the chance of death befalls you (thus). If ye doubt (their truth) detain them both after prayer and let them both swear by Allah: "We wish not in this for any worldly gain even though the (beneficiary) be our near relation: we shall hide not the evidence before Allah: if we do then behold! the sin be upon us!",Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Surah 5:107 ,                        But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin (of perjury) let two others stand forth in their places- nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right: let them swear by Allah: "We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two and that we have not trespassed (beyond the truth): if we did behold! the wrong be upon us!",Amma; aga bea kpedin ke zaguba'ba ajin le'fi (eri ganmana na) to a wa za guba ndocizhi agikini kingiba'bo nazhi -- yin gan zamafari zhina acia la kutiazhi be Sokoe kede: "Hakika erijin yanyi ugboka gan erijin yan'a yi ma gbin iyaka tua yima gaa gbigbintu gaskiya to hakika yi gaa fe dan mini azwalumizhio.

Surah 5:108 ,                    That is most suitable: that they may give the evidence in its true nature and shape or else they would fear that other oaths would be taken after their oaths. But fear Allah and listen (to His counsel): for Allah guideth not a rebellious people,Wuncin ga tsoba gaskiya gan'o na aga eri jin eti kendoe uga yi yi nao amaa sundan ebo abea kutizhi laa zheban da eba (egun gicizhi) ma baci yan kutizhiazhio ma.

Say: "Nay! but I am commanded to be the first of those who bow to Allah (in Islam) and be not thou of the company of those who join gods with Allah.",Gangan: "Ngba zandoci na jin Soka na uga mia la Ndakatao ala'li ma wyun ga ca jinjin alitta yan sanmazhi to kin yin'o Wyun ga mae ya yandondo cie giozando mae yau gia Gangan: Akika mi ajin mi foro gan mi'n la'nfe kakan ca yan za na'ata kpatsun ya Soko na ye mae ga'afe dan mini zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci na ma.

Surah 6:19  ,                                  Say: "What thing is most weighty in evidence" Say: "Allah is witness between me and you; This Qur´an hath been revealed to me by inspiration that I may warn you and all whom it reaches. Can ye possibly bear witness that besides Allah there is another Allah" Say: "Nay! I cannot bear witness!" Say: "But in truth He is the one Allah and I truly am innocent of (your blasphemy of) joining others with Him.",Gangan: "Ngba ki'I wancin gan eba eri jin bo" Gan gan: Soko tsayi Erio dan tsakani mi bo be ye yin'o.

Surah 6:20  ,          Those to whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons. Those who have lost their own souls refuse therefore to believe.,Zanazhi Yi la litafi ya na e'kpe'u ye kendoe e'kpe egi mimaciazhi ye na.

Surah 6:27,               If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with the Fire! They will say: "Would that we were but sent back!

Surah 6:28,               Yea in their own (eyes) will become manifest what before they concealed. But if they were returned they would certainly relapse to the things they were forbidden for they are indeed liars.,A a yanna danbo na akika yanna afe so shidzo batsozhio na wun'a tula ya'a.

Surah 6:30 ,                 If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with their Lord! He will say: "Is not this the truth" They will say: "Yea by our Lord!"

Surah 6:31 ,                        Lost indeed are they who treat it as a falsehood that they must meet Allah- until on a sudden the hour is on them and they say: "Ah! woe unto us that we took no thought of it"; for they bear their burdens on their backs and evil indeed are the burdens that they bear,Akika za nazhia ganmana la'adan alamari yan gungun'a be Sokoe na ajin hasara harda lokaci na alkiyami ga be ya kpaketeyin na acia gangan: Kasa ro-- nkpe yi re! eti yan nazhi yi lugwa ci jin'a na!

Surah 6:32   ,         What is the life of this world but play and amusement But best is the home in the hereafter for those who are righteous. Will ye not then understand,Edunfe izhe ma ufea sai de edzo be shagalae akika ma emi yan zoba ude alheri gan ya za nazhi gae tswa Soko acie sundau'na. Kashi ye de ankali dea.
Surah 6:33 ,            We know indeed the grief which their words do cause thee: It is not thee they reject: it is the signs of Allah which the wicked contemn.,Akika yi kpewo ke de egan nazhie da gan na wun'e nyin wyoe yangban na. To akika a yi wyoe ganmannazunci (yangban'azhi boa) amma'ade azwalumizhi de egbo mi gbo be aya Soko (Zhiy).
Surah 6:34 ,                    Rejected were the messengers before thee: with patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs until Our aid did reach them: there is none that can alter the words (and decrees) of Allah. Already hast thou received some account of those messengers,Akika ma a yi Tuci zhi ganmana zuncizhi shi wyodzo leani acie hankuri jin ta eti yanna a yia gan ganmanna zunci na ama jin'a egun harda lokaci na taimako be be ya'na za ndondo ma la egwasan dan hukunci Soko woa.

Surah 6:35   ,                        If their spurning is hard on thy mind yet if thou wert able to seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign- (what good). If it were Allah´s will He could gather them together unto true guidance: so be not thou amongst those who are swayed by ignorance (and impatience)!,Wyo ma gae le ye gan cice leba'a (be wyo yin) wun'a gbota fi wyoe to uga ye jin ya wyoe da wa yan na wyo ga'a da lo kin na koma ekpa ndoci na wyo ga da lo sanma na ebo wyo la aya zankpe ndoci obe o ya'a (a kokari jin).

Surah 6:36  ,       Those who listen (in truth) be sure will accept: as to the dead Allah will raise them up; then will they be turned unto Him,Akika de za nazhi gae shi tukpa ganni (be hankalina) a gae -- gan'o zanazhi ma ga tsuani na Sokoa bea la nakin aci ga la zheba da tsun'U.
Surah 6:37 ,                 They say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord" Say: "Allah hath certainly power to send down a sign: but most of them understand not,Aci gan: "Kii la aci cin aya (zankpe) be yau dagan eba Tsociu boa yin'o" Gangan: Akika Soko Etsu kagbo uyio na wyu'a cin aya beyin na amma'ade ekundondoazhi ade kpikpea.
Surah 6:38,                     There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth nor a being that flies on its wings but (forms part of) communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book and they (all) shall be gathered to their Lord in the end.,Amade dabba ndondo dan mini kin nana boa ama de elugi (eyan fufungi) naefu be gwapauzhi naa sai de atso jamazhi ayio dozhin iri nyan ye.

Surah 6:38  ,                   There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth nor a being that flies on its wings but (forms part of) communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book and they (all) shall be gathered to their Lord in the end,Amade dabba ndondo dan mini kin nana boa ama de elugi (eyan fufungi) naefu be gwapauzhi naa sai de atso jamazhi ayio dozhin iri nyan ye. Yi ma ya yandondo ye dan mini Litafi nna boa gancin ma eba Tsociabo akua yekanzhio.
Surah 6:39   ,             Those who reject our signs are deaf and dumb- in the midst of darkness profound: whom Allah willeth He leaveth to wander: whom He willeth He placeth on the way that is straight,Za nazhi ma'a aya Yi zhi yi ganmana na tukpa tencizhi ayio edingizhi ma ayio fi mini bazhikozhio. Zana ga ba Soko na ugau ya yan'u gun egbin'o zana ma ga bau na u gau la'afe ta eti eko gboro.
Surah 6:40    ,          Say: "Think ye to yourselves if there come upon you the wrath of Allah or the Hour (that ye dread) would ye then call upon other than Allah- (reply) if ye are truthful!,Gan gan: Ye le ye lea ngba azaba Soko gabe yaye ko ma ekin na Alkiyami ci be ya ye zandoci najin Sokoa na ga ye yea fe yiyeo Wun'a yi eza gaskiya zhi ye yio na.
Surah 6:41  ,         "Nay- On Him would ye call and if it be His will He would remove (the distress) which occasioned your call upon Him and ye would forget (the false gods) which ye join with Him!",Ngan Soko gbaugi ga ye yeafe yi yeo U ci ga yanna ye laa yiu yena la'ake yabo yaye uga bau na yeci ga yannazhi ye la'a pau baci na ba tan.
Surah 6:42  ,        Before thee We sent (messengers) to many nations and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity that they might learn humility,Akika ma Yi tun (Tucizhi) fi al'ummazhi nazhi be shiwyodzo na (agwo 'gan'a) ebo acin'o yicia wan be ebayibazhi be eyan gunzhi watakila be wuncin'y a dakpya ya Soko.
Surah 6:43  ,           When the suffering reached them from us why then did they not learn humility On the contrary their hearts became hardened and Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them,To eboki'ibo kamina azaba bayiba Yi zhi be etiana aci dakpya'a yan'o Ammade yangban'azhi cia gboka shetan cia etun (dede) nazhie lo na la'apanin fia.
Surah 6:44    ,               But when they forgot the warning they had received We opened to them the gates of all (good) things until in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts on a sudden We called them to account when lo! they were plunged in despair!,Gancin kamina abea tanba la'a lo dan yannazhi ala san'atu na Yicia ekozhi kpe ya'a yan yandondo har da kamina afe fayangban (eti alfario) be yannazhi ala ya'na yi cia wan winwan yan giriku kanga ma acindan hali dede yan gigizhi boa ni.
Surah 6:46 ,                     Say: "Think ye if Allah took away your hearing and your sight and sealed up your hearts who - a god other than Allah - could restore them to you" See how We explain the signs by various (symbols); yet they turn aside.,Gan gan: Kashi ye le yea Soko ga gwo ganwo ye to bacinle yezhi be ye yin Ucia eyan la'ata yangban yezhi Tsoci kici danbo baci Soko na'alauzhin be ya ye nao Cin kendoe yie la ayazhi be ya'a kakayin na le gancin ma elaa panke eko guru lugwa.
Surah 6:47    ,         Say: "Think ye if the punishment of Allah comes to you whether suddenly or openly will any be destroyed except those who do wrong,Gan gan: Ye lr ye lea azaba yan Soko gadabe yaye kpa keteyin (be girikui) koma gbangbae ngan Sokoa jin zandondo hallaka'a sai de jama'a nazhi gayi azwalumzhi na.
Surah 6:48 ,             We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those who believe and mend (their lives)- upon them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.,Yimae tun Tucizhi tuntun'a sai de ebo abea ya (za guruzhi) buhsara ama'ajin (za dedezhi) gangba. Ebo acin'ozana gabea imani jin na ucia bolobolo la'adan etun'uzhio na to dansun ndondo danbo ya'a ama'ale yangban nyin ye a.
Surah 6:49  ,     But those who reject our signs- them shall punishment touch for that they ceased not from transgressing,Zanazhi ma aya Yizhi (zankpe Soko) yi ganmana na azaba (Soko) ga'toa ebo etun nazhi afe lo yan fasikancizhi na.
Surah 6:50  ,                         Say: "I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah nor do I know what is hidden nor do I tell you I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me." Say: "can the blind be held equal to the seeing" Will ye then consider not,Gan gan: "Mia gan ya ye gan edzunba yan arziki Soko zhi dan be mi yin'a. Mi ma de kpikpe yan na'a swo na mi ma'agan yaye gan malaika mi yia. Mide la'mitu yandondoa sai de yanna aga jin wahayiu be yami na'. Gan gan: Ngba yebonci be za nae leba ye na ga'zhe yeni Kashi ye kpaye kpa'a.
Surah 6:51  ,              Give this warning to those in whose (hearts) is the fear that they will be brought (to judgment) before their Lord: except for Him they will have no protector nor intercessor: that they may guard (against evil).,Wyo mao la wun'ojin gangbao ya zanazhi gae sundan yan kuku na'akua yekan lo eba Tsocia na ade Ndakata ndoci zunmau boa zando madanbo na'a tangwa'a na'a watakila a tswa Soko ama sundan U.
Surah 6:52     ,                   Send not away those who call on their Lord morning and evening seeking His face. In naught art thou accountable for them and in naught are they accountable for thee that thou shouldst turn them away and thus be (one) of the unjust,Wyo mao ga nyan za nazhie yi Tsocia ye to lazhin to lozun'y acie wa yarda Soko za na ma aala egagba yan etun'a ndondo gbin wyo ya'a ama'ala egagba yan etun wyoe ndondo gbin'a. Ebo acin'o wyo ga nyan'a to wyo ga'fe dan mini azwalumizhio.
Surah 6:53    ,          Thus did We try some of them by comparison with others that they should say: "Is it these then that Allah hath favoured from amongst us" Doth not Allah know best those who are grateful,Acinga gamao Yi jin sashiazhi fitina be sashiazhi ebo adeba'agangan: Ngba za nanazhi ga Soko la falala ya mini yibo Asa ujin Soko tsa kpe gan mini wuzhiuzhio za nazhi gae jin yebo yau na'a.
Surah 6:54  ,                        When those come to thee who believe in Our signs Say: "Peace be on you: Your Lord hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) mercy: verily if any of you did evil in ignorance and thereafter repented and amend (his conduct) lo! He is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Kamina ma za nazhia imani jin be aya Yizhi na gabe eba wyo na to gangan: Aminci (yan Soko) ulaujin tabbata'uta etiyebo: Tsociye wyun'a yegun la'ajin ti'ile ta etiubo ke de zandondo naga lo'tun dede mini'ebo eti rakpebo na gancin uci be'a tuba jin zunma wuncin'o tadzu na to akika Soko Etsu gafara Uyio Etsu yegun Uyio.
Surah 6:55,     Thus do We explain the signs in detail: that the way of the sinners may be shown up.,Acinga ga ma Yi ye kpe ayazhi ri kaka yin'o to ebo ma eko yan lefi jincizhi ula'u tu'ula.
Surah 6:56 ,                   Say: "I am forbidden to worship those - others than Allah - whom ye call upon." Say: "I will not follow your wain desires: If I did I would stray from the path and be not of the company of those who receive guidance.",Gan gan: Akika mi a kan mi gan mi'nga jin bauta ya za nazhi ye'jin bauta ya zuma Soko na ma. Gan gan: Mia la'mi tu etun yangban yezhia (ebo na miga jin acin) akika miga gbin. Kanga ma mia fe dan mini eza bawuzhi boa.
Surah 6:57    ,                 Say: "For me I (work) on a clear sign from my Lord but ye reject Him. What ye would see hastened is not in my power. The command rests with none but Allah: He declares the truth and He is the best of judges.",Gan gan: Mi ta eti hujjakozhi na febe dagan eba Tsoci mibo na ye mau yi ganmana. Yanna ma ye dinye gan ala be nahukunciu dangwa mi boa hukunci de undan'a sai be Sokoe wyun'e ya labari gaskiya wyun ga ma yi Etsu na gan za nazhi man yan kperi kpata nao.
Surah 6:58,             Say: "If what ye would see hastened were in my power the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But Allah knoweth best those who do wrong.",Gan gan: Akika da'aci gan yan na ye din ye'una be mi yin udan'o akika da aga hukunci ba tsakani mi bo be ye yin'ani Soko tsa ma kpe gan'o yan yanna azwalumizhi dan'y ninbo nao.
Surah 6:59 ,                             With Him are the keys of the unseen the treasures that none knoweth but He. He knoweth whatever there is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf doth fall but with His knowledge: there is not a grain in the darkness (or depths) of the earth nor anything fresh or dry (green or withered) but is (inscribed) in a record clear (to those who can read).,Ebau bo gabo giyekozhi yan eyan swiswoci kpata fio zandondo ma kpea yea sai wyun tso.

Surah 6:60,                     It is He who doth take your souls by night and hath knowledge of all that ye have done by day: by day doth He raise you up again; that a term appointed be fulfilled; In the end unto Him will be your return; then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.,Wyunga mae gwo rayi yezhi be yeshi yin'o u ma yi be kpikpe yan yannazhi ye dajin be igidi'ina gancin ma uga ye la'anakin mini ubo ebo hukunci ndoci yan lokaci nayi kikaci na gancin ma ebau gabo ezhekeba yedan'o gancin ucia yaye labari etun nazhi ye fe lo na.
Surah 6:61,                He is the irresistible (watching) from above over His worshippers and He sets guardians over you. At length when death approaches one of you Our angels take his soul and they never fail in their duty.,Wyun ga mayi Etsu na zankpeu wun'a rukpe eti wuzhiuzhio nao U mae tun (malaika) etswazhi fia harda lokaci na ajali gabe ya zaeni miniebona Tuci Yizhi cia -- rayi beayin amae ya ye dan alamari wuncin boa.
Surah 6:62 ,          Then are men returned unto Allah their protector the (only) reality: Is not His the command and He is the swiftest in taking account.,Gancin aci ga'a ku zheban da tsun Soko Ndakata'a yan gaskiya tso. E shi tukpa! Wyun ga wun hukuncio wyun ga ma yi Etsu na fan gan eba egagbao nao.
Surah 6:63   ,             Say: "Who is it that delivereth you from the dark recesses of land and sea when ye call upon Him in humility and silent terror: ´If He only delivers us from these (dangers) (we vow) we shall truly show our gratitude´",Gan gan: "Zie gwo ye tswa dagan mini bazhiko kin zhio to edu zhibo Yecia jin ye fe yiu be ekpyadae to swiswoci; kede ugayi wadzun dagan mini mimacinle nanao akika yigafe dan mini zanazhie jin yebo Soko na.
Surah 6:64     ,    Say "It is Allah that delivereth you from these and all (other) distresses: and yet ye worship false gods!",Gan gan: Soko ga wa yedzun dagan miniabo to dagan yangbanyin ndondo gancin yecie la yan pa Soko baci.
Surah 6:65  ,                        Say: "He hath power to send calamities on you from above and below or to cover you with confusion in party strife giving you a taste of mutual vengeance - each from the other." See how We explain the signs by various (symbols); that they may understand.,Gan gan: "Wyin (Soko) ga de I'ko na wyun'a tun azaba fi ye dagan etitayebo nao koma dagan tako bici yezhio koma wyun'e zhekeba kpere-kpere Uci fe ya sashiezhi masiba yan sashi zhi fin."

Surah 6:66 ,       But thy people reject this though it is the truth. Say: "Not mine is the responsibility for arranging your affairs,Jama'a yan wyozhi ma a egan wyoe yi ganmana wuncin ga mayi gaskiyao. Gangan: Mi de jin wakili ta eti yeboa
.Surah 6:67    For every message is a limit of time and soon shall ye know it.",Labari ndondo de ekpegiba bele yin ma yea be de kpikpe.
Surah 6:68 ,                     When thou seest men engaged in vain discourse about Our signs turn away from them unless they turn to a different theme. If Satan ever makes thee forget then after recollection sit not thou in the company of those who do wrong,Wyo ma ga be le za nazhie dzo'mi fi aya Yizhi na ye to a kpe ya eba'abo har sai aga lo dan egan ndocio najin wuncin'a na. Uma gabea jin faruwa gan shetan yan tanba la'ace tu wyoe to ga kara fedun baci sinsantuo be jama'a nazhi yi azwalumizhi na ma.
Surah 6:69 ,          On their account no responsibility falls on the righteous but (their duty) is to remind them that they may (learn to) fear Allah.,Egagba yan lefi ndondo yan za na nazhie dzomi fi aya Soko na uta eti zanazhi gae tswa Soko acie sundan'u naboa amma'ade sinsantu danbo (ya atso) ujinwo atso wuncinzhi ga'afe za nazhia tswa Soko cia sundan'u na.
Surah 6:70 ,                                           Leave alone those who take their religion to be mere play and amusement and are deceived by the life of this world. But proclaim (to them) this (truth): that every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own acts: it will find for itself no protector or intercessor except Allah: if it offered every ransom (or reparation) none will be accepted: such is (the end of) those who deliver themselves to ruin by their own acts: they will have for drink (only) boiling water and for punishment one most grievous: for they persisted in rejecting Allah.,Zanazhi ma a adinia la eyan edzo be shahawa izhe na harma izhe cia ta na a ya yan'a wyo deo la Alkur'anuo san'atu.

Surah 6:100    ,          Yet they make the Jinns equals with Allah though Allah did create the Jinns; and they falsely having no knowledge attribute to Him sons and daughters.

Surah 6:108,                        Revile not ye those whom they call upon besides Allah lest they out of spite revile Allah in their ignorance.

Surah 6:112   ,                   Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy- evil ones among men and jinns inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception.

Surah 6:119  ,                           Why should ye not eat of (meats) on which Allah´s name hath been pronounced when He hath explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you - except under compulsion of necessity But many do mislead (men) by their appetites unchecked by knowledge. Thy Lord knoweth best those who transgress.,Ki-ma jin ye yeo yecia gi yanna atun sunna Soko ye ta eti uboa na' yin'o alalima wyun'a eganzhi kpe ye ya ye kaka yin yan nazhi ulaji haramu na ya ye yeani nao Saide ena ti'ilebo ga bea de ye lo ebau na akika ma ekundondo zazhi e-kuzazhi fi egbin'o be etun yangban'azhi eti rakpe bo.

Surah 6:121   ,                Eat not of (meats) on which Allah´s name hath not been pronounced: That would be impiety. But the evil ones ever inspire their friends to contend with you if ye were to obey them ye would indeed be Pagans.,Ye mae ga gi dagan mini (eyan zunzunci) naa tun sunna Soko ye ta etiuboa na ma akika wuncin fasikanci uyio.

.Surah 6:122,                       Can he who was dead to whom We gave life and a light whereby he can walk amongst men be like him who is in the depths of darkness from which he can never come out Thus to those without faith their own deeds seem pleasing,Ngba za na'afe eyan tsutsuci na ganci Yiciu dan rayi Yici ke zhea haske la'ayau na wyu'a fe la dazan dan tacin zawangizhiona ngba zawuncin ga'azhe ye ni be dozhin'u na gun mini bazhikozhio nama wyun'a dzun boa na Acinga ga e-la ninpa dan etun dedezhi ya kafirizhio.
Surah 6:123,              Thus have We placed leaders in every town its wicked men to plot (and burrow) therein: but they only plot against their own souls and they perceive it not.,Acinga ga ma Yi laufe dan alkarya ndondo bo gbangban yan dzoshiciazhi aga yi lefi jinci gbonta zhio ebo adeba pa makirinci dedezhi a dan miniubo a ma'ade makirinci dede na'apa na'a sai de na'agia tso rayizhi naatso mae wo sansan wuncin'a.
Surah 6:124  ,                          When there comes to them a sign (from Allah) They say: "We shall not believe until we receive one (exactly) like those received by Allah´s messengers." Allah knoweth best where (and how) to carry out His mission. Soon will the wicked be overtaken by humiliation before Allah and a severe punishment for all their plots.,Kamina ma a ya gabe ya'a (nae wu zan kpe Soko) na a gan: 'yi yia ajin imania sai aga be yayi be iri yannazhi alaya tuci Soko zhi na'.

Surah 6:125 ,                          Those whom Allah (in His plan) willeth to guide- He openeth their breast to Islam; those whom He willeth to leave straying- He maketh their breast close and constricted as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth Allah (heap) the penalty on those who refuse to believe.,Ebo acin'o zana Soko gae kpa gan wyun'a lau ke eko na Uga yan gban'u la'a fe gwi gwoci ya musulunci zana ma uga'akpa ci gan wyuan yaugun egbin'o na uga yangban'u lazhe pinpinci uci g'yiku ke wyoa gan gan wyun'e gun sanma gun na Acinga ga Sokoa jin ula shikan kpe eti zanazhie jin imani a na'o.
Surah 6:126 ,       This is the way of thy Lord leading straight: We have detailed the signs for those who receive admonition.,Nana gayi ekpa Tso ci wyoe nayi gboro na'o. Akika Yia ayazhi kpe ye kakayin ya jama nazhie gwo sinsantu na.
Surah 6:127,         For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord: He will be their friend because they practised (righteousness).,(Zawuncizhi) Ayi be emi yan aminci dan eba Tsocia bo wun ga ma yi Ndakata'ao ebo iri etun nazhi afe lo na.
Surah 6:128  ,                                One day will He gather them all together (and say): "O ye assembly of Jinns! Much (toll) did ye take of men." Their friends amongst men will say: "Our Lord! we made profit from each other: but (alas!) we reached our term - which thou didst appoint for us." He will say: "The Fire be your dwelling-place: you will dwell therein for ever except as Allah willeth." for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.,Fo na ma Uga'kua yekan baenio na (Wyun'a gan gan) "ya ye jama' yan jannuzhi!

Surah 6:129,       Thus do we make the wrong-doers turn to each other because of what they earn.,Acinga ga ma Yia jin Yeiela edzoshi yizhe yan sashi azwalumizhi a dan sashiazhi gwabo ebo iri etun dede nazhie lo na.
Surah 6:130,                          "O ye assembly of Jinns and men! came there not unto you messengers from amongst you setting forth unto you My signs and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours" They will say: "We bear witness against ourselves." It was the life of this world that deceived them. So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected Faith.,Ya ye jama'a yan jannuzhi to zawangizhi! Asa Tucizhi be yaye dagan mini yeboa acie ya labari yan aya Mizhi ya ye yea acie na ye wun eti gungun nyan ye be efo ye nana yin'a A cigan: 'yi de jin ri ta eti tacin yi tso.

Surah 6:131,         (The messengers were sent) thus for thy Lord would not destroy for their wrong-doing men´s habitations whilst their occupants were unwarned.,Wuncin ma'afe ebo na Tsoci wyoe wyun'ajin alkarya ndondo hallaka eti zwaluncio alali-ma jamaa yan kinzhi kpea yan'a.
Surah 6:132 ,       To all are degrees (or ranks) according to their deeds: for thy Lord is not unmindful of anything that they do.,Al'umma ndondo ma uyi be darajauzhi dagan mini etun nazhi aga lo na. Tsoci wyo ma ufe Etsu nae ya ye ke etun nazhi ye lo na lugwaa.
Surah 6:133,                 Thy Lord is self-sufficient full of Mercy: if it were His will He could destroy you and in your place appoint whom He will as your successors even as He raised you up from the posterity of other people.,Tsoci wyo ma Etsu bagwo uyio na de ye gun na. Uga bau Ugae fin ya (baenio) Ucia jin zandondo na ga bau na kendoe de ndocizhio kayin na.
Surah 6:134,      All that hath been promised unto you will come to pass: nor can ye frustrate it (in the least bit).,Akika yannazhi e la jin ye alkawali na akika wun'a da be ye ma jin zanazhi gangwa na'a.Surah 6:135                 Say: "O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): soon will ye know who it is whose end will be (best) in the Hereafter: certain it is that the wrong-doers will not prosper."Gan gan: Ya ye jama'a yan mi zhi!

Surah 6:136,                              Out of what Allah hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle they assigned Him a share: they say according to their fancies: "This is for Allah and this" - for our "partners"! but the share of their" partners "reacheth not Allah whilst the share of Allah reacheth their "partners" ! evil (and unjust) is their assignment!,Acia kansan ndo ci la'a shi shi ya Soko dagan mini yan na udzoyan'a nyan yan gi ci latizhi to dabbazhi naaci gan: Nana ma yan kuti yizhi a yio.

Surah 6:137 ,                  Even so in the eyes of most of the pagans their "partners" made alluring the slaughter of their children in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion. If Allah had willed they would not have done so: But leave alone them and their inventions.,Acinga ga ma yannazhie la pa Soko baci na a ninpa la'adan ya ekun dondo mushirikizhi wuwu yan egi azhi ebo adeba'ala ajin hallaka ama'ala rikicia la'adan adiniaboa ya'a.

Surah 6:138,                         And they say that such and such cattle and crops are taboo and none should eat of them except those whom - so they say - We wish; further there are cattle forbidden to yoke or burden and cattle on which (at slaughter) the name of Allah is not pronounced; - inventions against Allah´s name: soon will He requite them for their inventions.,Amagan: yannazhi fi gbako yan dabba nanazhio na tsitsaci uyio ya bagi yizhi uma yi eyan kinkanci (haramu) ya yinmi yizhi.

Surah 6:139  ,                   They say: "What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is specially reserved (for food) for our men and forbidden to our women; but if it is still-born then all have share therein. For their (false) attribution (of superstitions to Allah) He will soon punish them: for He is full of wisdom and knowledge.,Akika zanazhi san wawa cia egiazhi wu eti rakpebo na ajin hasara. Acia arziki na Soko ya'na la'ajin haramu ya tia eti ganmana na'atswa ta Soko na akika a'gbin ama fe zanazhi ke eko na'a.
Surah 6:140   ,                Lost are those who slay their children from folly without knowledge and forbid food which Allah hath provided for them inventing (lies) against Allah. They have indeed gone astray and heeded no guidance.,Wyun ga ma yi etsu na ca jin jin cigban latizhi na'o ndocizhi wunkpa be wuruzhi to ndocizhi nazhi de wurua na to dobinazhi to eyandzozhi nazhi yangiciazhia kperi be dozhi na to nazhi be dozhia na E gi dagan mini yangicisunsun'uzhio kamina aga nyin tin ya na ye mae la hakkiuzhie wa fona ye ga da ku yangici lati na yemae ga nyin yangici ya ma Akika ma Sokoe wa za nazhi gae nyin yan na'a.
Surah 6:141   ,                           It is He Who produceth gardens with trellises and without and dates and tilth with produce of all kinds and olives and pomegranates similar (in kind) and different (in variety): eat of their fruit in their season but render the dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered. But waste not by excess: for Allah loveth not the wasters.,Mini dabbazhio ma ade nazhie la karazhi na to nazhi ye ta cici cie zun gi na egi dagan mini arziki na Soko la yaye nao ye mae ga lamitu ekpa shetan zhi ma. Akika eza nanvo yan gbangba uyi ya ye yeo.
Surah 6:142,               Of the cattle are some for burden and some for meat: eat what Allah hath provided for you and follow not the footsteps of Satan: for he is to you and avowed enemy.,Iri gutwota a yio dagan mini yan wurezhio ade guba amade guba dagan mini kingbagbazhio.

Surah 6:143,                      (Take) eight (head of cattle) in (four) pairs: of sheep a pair and of goats a pair; say hath He forbidden the two males or the two females or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose Tell me with knowledge if ye are truthful:,Dagan mini rakumizhio ade iri guba to mini nankozhio ade iri guba Gangan ngba eba guba tso uljin haramuo kashi yiwo guba kashi yanna ewan yan yiwo guba ga gunyekan eti ubo na Kashi ye danbodan eri jinci zhi kamina Soko jin ye wasi yanci ba nanae na Ngba zi'i jin zwalunci a gan zana tswa ganmana cia ta Soko ebo udebau gbin zawangizhi eti rakpebo nao Akika Sokoe la jama'a yan azwalumizhi ke eko wangia.
Surah 6:144  ,                                     Of camels a pair and oxen a pair; say hath He forbidden the two males or the two females or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose - Were ye present when Allah ordered you such a thing But who doth more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allah to lead astray men without knowledge For Allah guideth not people who do wrong.,Dagan mini rakumbo guba danbo dagan mini nankoma guba danbo.

Surah 6:145  ,                                    Say: "I find not in the message received by me by inspiration any (meat) forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it unless it be dead meat or blood poured forth or the flesh of swine- for it is an abomination - or what is impious (meat) on which a name has been invoked other than Allah´s". But (even so) if a person is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits- thy Lord is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Gangan: mi tsun dan mini yan naa jin wahayi ya mi na bo'a yandoci na yi haramu ta eti zanagi yangici ndoci na'a saide ugazhe musari ko ma egya jijeci ko ma nakan kputsun to akika wuncin eyan gwosun uyio ko ma fasikanci na'azun be sunna ndoci najin yan Sokoa na.

Surah 6:146   ,                        For those who followed the Jewish Law We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof and We forbade them that fat of the ox and the sheep except what adheres to their backs or their entrails or is mixed up with a bone: this in recompense for their wilful disobedience: for We are true (in Our ordinances).,Yi ma dabba ndondo na de eku na (ko vundunu na) la'ajin haramu ya yahudu zhi to mini nankozhio to nangizhio Yia emiazhi la'ajin haramu ya'a sai de nazhi ga kpe eba zunma'azhio na ko ma kaya gbakozhio na ko ma na ga bo keba be tsukun'y na wunci ga Yi yia ga'a gbao ebo gbugbukeazhi bo.

So did their ancestors argue falsely until they tasted of Our wrath. Say: "Have ye any (certain) knowledge If so produce it before us. Ye follow nothing but conjecture: ye do nothing but lie.",Zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci na'a gan gan: Da'wun'a ba Soko ba yi yia la yan pau bacia to babayizhia. Da yi ma 'ala yandondo jin haramu woa.

Now then hath come unto you a clear (sign) from your Lord- and a guide and a mercy: then who could do more wrong than one who rejecteth Allah´s signs and turneth away therefrom In good time shall We requite those who turn away from Our signs with a dreadful penalty for their turning away.,Ko ma ye fe gan gan: Da ci gan yi acin litafi be yao da yi ga fe eza bawuzhi gan'a to akika bayanizhi be ya ye dagan eba Tsoci yebo to bawu to ye gun.
