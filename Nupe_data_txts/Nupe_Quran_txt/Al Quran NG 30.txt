Surah 30:30 ,                    So set thou thy face steadily and truly to the Faith: (establish) Allah´s handiwork according to the pattern on which He has made mankind: no change (let there be) in the work (wrought) by Allah: that is the standard Religion: but most among mankind understand not.,A' nakan kpace wyoe ku gikini be jinjin adini'i a pan yeshi baenio da ekpa yan gaskiya jin jin yan Soko u yio nan wun'ajin halitta zawangizhi eti ubo nao Egwa san ndondo ma danbo ya yan nan Soko jin na'a wuncin ga yi addini yan gboro amma de ekun dondo zawangizhi a kpe'a.

Surah 30:33     ,            When trouble touches men they cry to their Lord turning back to Him in repentance: but when He gives them a taste of Mercy as from Himself behold some of them pay part-worship to other god´s besides their Lord-,Ka mi na batan ko egun uga de zawangi zhi nan a fe ti lali ya Tsocia aciga alamari kpata ku a kpe tso'u gancin u ga be'a yegun'U laa twarya ya sashi mini'abo a fe za nanzhi e la yan pa Soko baci nan.

Surah 30:39      ,               That which ye lay out for increase through the property of (other) people will have no increase with Allah: but that which ye lay out for charity seeking the Countenance of Allah (will increase): it is these who will get a recompense multiplied.,Yandondo nan ye ga la ya zazhi ebo u deba'ula'ube u dan mini ewo zazhio nan (ke ewo nuwan nan ko shasha nan) arziki yezhi a be nko Soko boa.

Surah 30:40    ,                 It is Allah Who has created you: further He has provided for your sustenance; then He will cause you to die; and again He will give you life.

Surah 30:41 ,             Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of (the meed) that the hands of men have earned that (Allah) may give them a taste of some of their deeds: in order that they may turn back (from Evil).,Eyan nyin'a tu la ta eti kin bo to mini eduzhio ebo etun dede nanzhi egwa zawangizhie lo nan. Ebo (Soko) u de bau jin'a azaba be sashi etun dede'azhi'i watakila be wuncin'y a ga egwa kpe etun dede zhio.

Surah 30:48         ,                  It is Allah Who sends the Winds and they raise the Clouds: then does He spread them in the sky as He wills and break them into fragments until thou seest rain-drops issue from the midst thereof: then when He has made them reach such of his servants as He wills behold they do rejoice!-,Soko gae tun efe tun'o U cie je girgije U cie ta'u kpe sanmao kendoe u ga ba'u nan.

Surah 30:51  ,      And if We (but) send a Wind from which they see (their tilth) turn yellow- behold they become thereafter Ungrateful (Unbelievers)!,Da a ci gan Yi tun efe tun fia aci da le yangici lati'azhi ye wiwoci da aga'fe zunman wuncin'o man'nan'awocizhi.
Surah 30:52  ,        So verily thou canst not make the dead to hear nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call when they show their backs and turn away.,Akika Wyo la ekun wo gan woa wyo ma la tukpa-tenci wo yiyi woa kamina a ga zunman zheta na'a.

Surah 30:54  ,                     It is Allah Who created you in a state of (helpless) weakness then gave (you) strength after weakness then after strength gave (you weakness and a hoary head: He creates as He wills and it is He Who has all knowledge and power.,Soko ga yi za nan ca jin-jin halitta ye dagan gbogunbo nao U ci kezhea kagbo l'a dan ye baci gbogunbo U ci kezhea gbogunbo la'adan ye baci kagbo ganni be ekuku'i.

Surah 30:55 ,          On the Day that the Hour (of Reckoning) will be established the transgressors will swear that they tarried not but an hour: thus were they used to being deluded!,Efo nan alkiyami ga nan nan eza lemba Soko (zhi) a zhi kuti gan a le izhe a gan yan lokaci ninia acinga ga uyio kamina a fi izheo nan ganmanan ga afe zun zao.
Surah 30:56        ,           But those endued with knowledge and faith will say: "Indeed ye did tarry within Allah´s Decree to the Day of Resurrection and this is the Day of Resurrection: but ye - ye were not aware!",Za nanzhi'ima Soko twarya kpikpe yanan cia gan gan: Ngan Ye yaa fe fi mini kabariyezhio mini hukunci Soko har da efo kin-nan ngan yinnan ga yi efo kinnao ammaade ye a fe za nanzhi de kpikpe'a nan.
Surah 30:57 ,       So on that Day no excuse of theirs will avail the transgressors nor will they be invited (then) to seek grace (by repentance).,Fo wuncin za nanzhi ga le izhe yan binankun nan uzuri ndondo nan aga ta nan wun'ajin'a amfani'a a ma ya atso kafa yan uzuri tao tsoa.
Surah 30:58      ,            verily We have propounded for men in this Qur´an every kind of Parable: But if thou bring to them any Sign the Unbelievers are sure to say "Ye do nothing but talk vanities.",Akika Yi yia misali ndondo nazhi a kunke nan la be dan mini Alkur'anu nanao ya zawangizhi. Ka wyo ma ga be ya be egwa wu yan zankpe ndocii kafirizhi a gan gan akika ye fe yandoa sai dai eyan nyin ci zhi.
