Surah 60:1                  ,                              O ye who believe! Take not my enemies and yours as friends (or protectors)- offering them (your) love even though they have rejected the Truth that has come to you and have (on the contrary) driven out the Prophet and yourselves (from your homes) (simply) because ye believe in Allah your Lord! If ye have come out to strive in My Way and to seek My Good Pleasure (take them not as friends) holding secret converse of love (and friendship) with them: for I know full well all that ye conceal and all that ye reveal. And any of you that does this has strayed from the Straight Path.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan e ga la makiri Mi to makiri yezhi eya manchizhi ma ye la cin cin wu'a a maa jin kafirinci be gaskiya nan be ya ye nae har e la Tuci nya dzun Mi mae jin'e gangba gan ye la imanie jin be Soko nan yi Tsoci ye nan wun'ayi gan ye tintinya ebo ekungun ta eti ekpa Mi bo nan ye' mae wa yeda Mi wa ga nan Ye' la cin cin wua swiswoci Mi ma de kpikpe yannanzhi ye swo nan to nan ye tula nan zaeni ndondo na ga jin acin miniebo nan akika wun'a ya ke eko gboro lugwa
Surah 60:2   ,         If they were to get the better of you they would behave to you as enemies and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you for evil: and they desire that ye should reject the Truth.,Ya wye Annabi Mumina ynzagizhi ga be eba wye acia mubaya'a jin (a alkawali yan imani jin) gan a'la yandondo pa Soko bacia a maayi yan'a a maa da yancin'a a ma wu egizhia a maa la egi yanci be ya ebaazhia a ma le foro wangi yan wyozhi baa wyo la mubaya'o jin bea yin(a yeda jin bea yin) wyo mao ba gafara yan Soko ya'a akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 60:3      ,      Of no profit to you will be your relatives and your children on the Day of Judgment: He will judge between you: for Allah sees well all that ye do.,Dangiezhi to egiezhi a'ajin'e anfani efo alkiyamia Soko ga gin-gan laadan tsakaniebo be dozhiy akika Sokoe le ye ye be iri etun nanzhi ye lo nan.
Surah 60:4            ,                                       There is for you an excellent example (to follow) in Abraham and those with him when they said to their people: "We are clear of you and of whatever ye worship besides Allah: we have rejected you and there has arisen between us and you enmity and hatred for ever- unless ye believe in Allah and Him alone": But not when Abraham said to his father: "I will pray for forgiveness for thee though I have no power (to get) aught on thy behalf from Allah." (They prayed): "Our Lord! in Thee do we trust and to Thee do we turn in repentance: to Thee is (our) Final Goal.,Akika ye de yesan wangi dan mini (Annabi) Ibrahimao to jama'a nanzhi dan be'uyin nan nyan kaminan a gan be jamaa yan kinmi'azhi gan: Akika Yi yia egwa yizhi wa be ye yin to yannan ye jin bauta ya ke Soko lugwa nan Yi maa ga jin kafirinci be ye yin ewunsun be nanvoe ma'a tula tsakani yi bo be ye yin har abada sai de ye ga imani jin be Sokoe gbaugi sai de egan nan Ibrahima gan be Baba'u yin nan akika mia ba gafara ya wye mi ma de mulki yandondo ya wye wo wba Soko boa.

Surah 60:5      ,      "Our Lord! Make us not a (test and) trial for the Unbelievers but forgive us our Lord! for Thou art the Exalted in Might the Wise.",Soko ga lugwayi ya'afe fitina ya kafirizhi ma wyo mao fa be yi yin akika wyo ga yi Etsu Zankpeo Etsu hikimao.
Surah 60:6           ,       There was indeed in them an excellent example for you to follow- for those whose hope is in Allah and in the Last Day. But if any turn away truly Allah is Free of all Wants Worthy of all Praise.,Akika ye de yesan wangi dan miniabo ammaa ya za nan gae jin kauna Soko be efo zobae nan. Zaeni ndondo nan ga zunma zheta gaskiya nan akika Soko Etsu kunke uyio Etsu nan zandondoe jin'yeba ya nan uyio.
Surah 60:7   ,           It may be that Allah will grant love (and friendship) between you and those whom ye (now) hold as enemies. For Allah has power (over all things); And Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Kengi uyio nan Soko ga cincin laadan tsakani yebo be za nanzhi ye nanvo miniabo nan Soko de kagbo eti wuncin'o. Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 60:8     ,               Allah forbids you not with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes from dealing kindly and justly with them: for Allah loveth those who are just.,Soko kan ye (adalinci'yn jin) be zananzhiy a gun ye kun mini adini boa naa yin'a ama ke nya yedzun emi yezhi boa e da gboro ye mae jin adalinci beayin akika Sokoe wa za nanzhi gae jin adalinci nan.
Surah 60:9  ,                  Allah only forbids you with regard to those who fight you for (your) Faith and drive you out of your homes and support (others) in driving you out from turning to them (for friendship and protection). It is such as turn to them (in these circumstances) that do wrong.,Ammade Soko kan'ye eti za nanzhie gun ye kun dan mini adinio nan to nanzhiy nyan ye tinya emi yezhio nan to za nanzhie jin taimako eti nyin nyan ye bo nan ega kara la'a eya mancizhi ma zandondo nan ga'a la eya manci nan akika zawuncizhi ga yi azwalumi zhio.
Surah 60:10               ,                                       O ye who believe! When there come to you believing women refugees examine (and test) them: Allah knows best as to their Faith: if ye ascertain that they are Believers then send them not back to the Unbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for the Unbelievers nor are the (Unbelievers) lawful (husbands) for them. But pay the Unbelievers what they have spent (on their dower) and there will be no blame on you if ye marry them on payment of their dower to them. But hold not to the guardianship of unbelieving women: ask for what ye have spent on their dowers and let the (Unbelievers) ask for what they have spent (on the dowers of women who come over to you). Such is the command of Allah: He judges (with justice) between you. And Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan kamina ynzagi Mumini nazhi ga'a kpe la be eba ye nan e ma'a cin le Soko ma de kpikpe yan imania gan U ga tula ya ye gan Muminazhi ayio e ga nyan'a kezhe da tsun kafirizhi be ma.

Akika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 60:11             ,       And if any of your wives deserts you to the Unbelievers and ye have an accession (by the coming over of a woman from the other side) then pay to those whose wives have deserted the equivalent of what they had spent (on their dower). And fear Allah in Whom ye believe.,Yandoci ga bea fan'ye gwa mini yinmi yezhio lwo eba kafirizhi yeci gun'a kun har nyan'atsozhi ci dazhin eba ye za nanzhiy nyinmiazhi ga daa nan yea kwatonci yan yannanzhi a ga wu nan la' ya'a ye mae sundan Soko nan ye jin imani be yin nan.
Surah 60:12        ,                             O Prophet! When believing women come to thee to take the oath of fealty to thee that they will not associate in worship any other thing whatever with Allah that they will not steal that they will not commit adultery (or fornication) that they will not kill their children that they will not utter slander intentionally forging falsehood and that they will not disobey thee in any just matter- then do thou receive their fealty and pray to Allah for the forgiveness (of their sins): for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Yaw ye Annabi Mumina ynzagizhi ga be eba wye acia mubaya'a jin (a alkwaali yan imani jin) gan a'la yandondo pa Soko bacia a maayi yan'a a maa da yancin'a a ma wu egizhia a maa la egi yanci be ya ebaazhia a ma le foro wangi yan wyozhi baa wyo la mubaya'o jin bea yin (a yeda jin bea yin) wyo mao ba gafara yan Soko ya'a akika Soko' Etsu gafara u yio Etsu yegun u yio
Surah 60:13     ,             O ye who believe! Turn not (for friendship) to people on whom is the Wrath of Allah of the Hereafter they are already in despair just as the Unbelievers are in despair about those (buried) in graves.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan e ga la za nanzhi Soko'a zhewun be'ayin nan eya mancizhi ma akika zawuncinzhi'a kauna ba be egagba wangi yan efo zobae kendoe kafirizhi ba kauna be ekun nanzhi fi kabarizhio na.
