Surah 33:1    ,         O Prophet! Fear Allah and hearken not to the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites: verily Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom.,Ya Wyoe Annabi Sundan Soko Wyo ma'oga la mi tu kafirizhi be munafikizhiy ma. Akika Soko Etsu kpikpe u yio Egba ma u yio dan jin-jin yandondo.
Surah 33:2  ,         But follow that which comes to thee by inspiration from thy Lord: for Allah is well acquainted with (all) that ye do.,Wyo ma o la mi o tu yan nan e la wahyi'u be ya wyoe dagan nko Tsoci o bo nan. Akika Soko yi be labari etun nanzhi ye lo nan.
Surah 33:3,     And put thy trust in Allah and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs.,Wyo mao la o yaokpe Soko Akika Soko a kunke Etsu nan eza'ayakpe nan.
Surah 33:4       ,                    Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his (one) body: nor has He made your wives whom ye divorce by Zihar your mothers: nor has He made your adopted sons your sons. Such is (only) your (manner of) speech by your mouths. But Allah tells (you) the Truth and He shows the (right) Way.,Soko la yangban guba dan nin yan nakankpace zaeni ndondo ye bo'a.

Surah 33:5  ,                         Call them by (the names of) their fathers: that is juster in the sight of Allah. But if ye know not their father´s (names call them) your Brothers in faith or your maulas. But there is no blame on you if ye make a mistake therein: (what counts is) the intention of your hearts: and Allah is Oft-Returning Most Merciful.,Efe yi (egi kpaci yezhi) da ba Baba'zhi wuncin ga yi gboro eba Soko bo.

Surah 33:6     ,                       The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves and his wives are their mothers. Blood-relations among each other have closer personal ties in the Decree of Allah. Than (the Brotherhood of) Believers and Muhajirs: nevertheless do ye what is just to your closest friends: such is the writing in the Decree (of Allah).,Annabi ga -- yin gan ya Muminizhi nan a ga la mi tu foro uzhi a gan yan ti tacin atsozhi nao Yinmin'uzhi ma Nnaazhi a yio.

Surah 33:7  ,              And remember We took from the prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah Abraham Moses and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant:,(Annabi) Wyo mao pa ka mi nan Yi la alkawalizhi be Annabi Soko (zhiy) nan (eti eyan-wu wangio). Yi ma la be wyo tsoe Yi ma ke la be Nuhu'y to Ibrahima to Musa to Isa egi yan Maryamae Akika Yi la alkawali nan le kpan nan bea yin.
Surah 33:8  ,     That (Allah) may question the (custodians) of Truth concerning the Truth they (were charged with): And He has prepared for the Unbelievers a grievous Penalty.,Ebo Soko u de ba ugbin za gaskiyazhi'u gan eti akika yan gaskiya boabo. Soko ma azaba na tannan jin shiri ka kafirizhi.
Surah 33:9  ,                  O ye who believe! Remember the Grace of Allah (bestowed) on you when there came down on you hosts (to overwhelm you): But We sent against them a hurricane and forces that ye saw not: but Allah sees (clearly) all that ye do.,Ya ye nanzhi gaskiya ya (be sokoe) nan e fe pa boye yan Soko nan tula ya ye kaminan ekun guncizhi dzun fi ye nan Yici tun efe-ko fia ganni be ekunguncizhi. Nanzhi ye tswo le ye'a nan. Akika Soko-e cin ye le be iri etun nanzhi ye lo nan.
Surah 33:10,               Behold! they came on you from above you and from below you and behold the eyes became dim and the hearts gaped up to the throats and ye imagined various (vain) thoughts about Allah!,Kamina a be dzun fi ye dagan ti-fin to tako ye bo nan. Kanga ma eye yezhi a da'yi dansun ma ashe yangban yezhi da iyaka ye ma fe kpayezhi kakayin be alamari Sokoe.
Surah 33:11 ,    In that situation were the Believers tried: they were shaken as by a tremendous shaking.,Baga gabo a man Muminizhi cin le-o aci du'a du-du nan gboka sarauyin nan.
Surah 33:12     ,       And behold! The Hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (even) say: "Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion!",Kaminan Munafikizhi to zanazhi imaniazhi a togbogun nan a fe da gan gan gan: Soko be Tuci'u yin jin yi alkawali ndondoa sai dai tita.
Surah 33:13     ,                   Behold! A party among them said: "Ye men of Yathrib! ye cannot stand (the attack)! therefore go back!" And a band of them ask for leave of the Prophet saying "Truly our houses are bare and exposed" though they were not exposed they intended nothing but to run away.,To kaminan jama'a ndocizhi miniabo gan gan: "Ya ye Madina cizhi ye de edun a fea (shi yegboro Annabi boa) ebo acin'o ekezhe (da emi ezhi).

Surah 33:14   ,          And if an entry had been effected to them from the sides of the (city) and they had been incited to sedition they would certainly have brought it to pass with none but a brief delay!,Da aga gan-gan fi'a Kansan ta ndondo aci wa be ayin gan a la egun a la a tswan addini a a ga yarda jin. Wuncin man u laa le izhe lokpa wo'a sai yan lokaci degi (nan Soko ga yaa nan).
Surah 33:15,            And yet they had already covenanted with Allah not to turn their backs and a covenant with Allah must (surely) be answered for.,Akika ma shidzo batsozhio (munafiki nnazhi) a jin Soko alkawali ke yea ya zunmanan akika ma alkawali Soko eyan uyio nan aa gbin'a. 
Surah 33:16       ,       Say: "Running away will not profit you if ye are running away from death or slaughter; and even if (ye do escape) no more than a brief (respite) will ye be allowed to enjoy!",Gan (ya) gan: ecibi wun'ajin'e amfania ye ga bici tsutsu ko ekun na. Ye maa woma izhe a gan yan lokaci degia.
Surah 33:17 ,                      Say: "Who is it that can screen you from Allah if it be His wish to give you punishment or to give you Mercy" Nor will they find for themselves besides Allah any protector or helper.,Gan (ya) gan: Zei danbo nan a -- ye tswa be Sokoe nao kamina Soko ga kpa ye be azabae ko be yegun'y nap Ye ma'ade Ndakata ko taimako jin-ci a -- Soko gan'a.
Surah 33:18  ,           Verily Allah knows those among you who keep back (men) and those who say to their brethren "Come along to us" but come not to the fight except for just a little while.,Akika Soko kpe za nanzhi e to alamarizhi gbogun nan ye mini yebo to za nanzhi'e gan be yegiazhi-gan: e dazhin be tsun yi nan. A tso man e lo ekun gunzhia sai degi miniabo.
Surah 33:19     ,                             Covetous over you. Then when fear comes thou wilt see them looking to thee their eyes revolving like (those of) one over whom hovers death: but when the fear is past they will smite you with sharp tongues covetous of goods. Such men have no faith and so Allah has made their deeds of none effect: and that is easy for Allah.,Za nnazhiy gaela taimako tanye yanbo gancin eyan dansun ga dzun fia wyo'a le eye'azhi ye fe danyi ke za nan tsutsu a rukpe u nan.

Surah 33:20                      They think that the Confederates have not withdrawn; and if the Confederates should come (again) they would wish they were in the deserts (wandering) among the Bedouins and seeking news about you (from a safe distance); and if they were in your midst they would fight but little.,E' kpaye kpa gan jama'a kungunci yan kafirizhi laa loa jama'a wuncinzhi ma ga ke da zhin wun'a ba (munafikizhi) gan wun'ayi ezhitizhi boafio na.

Surah 33:21    ,            Ye have indeed in the Messenger of Allah a beautiful pattern (of conduct) for any one whose hope is in Allah and the Final Day and who engages much in the Praise of Allah.,Akika ye de yesan wangi dan mini yan Tuci Soko (nan yea sanye nan) ya zandondo nan gaejin kauna Soko be egagba wangi efo zobae nan u mae kezhe tun Soko ye dokun nan.
Surah 33:22           ,      When the Believers saw the Confederate forces they said: "This is what Allah and his Messenger had promised us and Allah and His Messenger told us what was true." And it only added to their faith and their zeal in obedience.,Kamnan Muminizhi le jama'a kungunci yan kafirizhi ye nan a gan: nan-nan gayi alkawali nan Soko be Tuci'u yin jin yi nao akika Soko be Tuci'u yin ma a gaskiya ta wuncin ma be'a yandondoa sai dai imani ganni be kpatsun ta ya Sokoe.
Surah 33:23        ,         Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah: of them some have completed their vow (to the extreme) and some (still) wait: but they have never changed (their determination) in the least:,Mini Muminizhio bagizhi danbo nanzhi wu'gwa gaskiya eti alkawali nanzhi ajin be Sokoe nan. Ade nanzhi efo'azhi a zoani nan a ma de nanzhi e tu (efo ajaliazhi) ye nan a ma la gwasan ndondo dan (alkawali'azhi) boa.
Surah 33:25       ,        And Allah turned back the Unbelievers for (all) their fury: no advantage did they gain; and enough is Allah for the believers in their fight. And Allah is full of Strength able to enforce His Will.,Soko a kafirizhi yan daa zunma gan-ni be ewunzheazhiy a ma tso guri alhairi ndondoa Soko cia kunke ya Muminizhi be ekungun'y akika Soko Etsu kagbo uyio Etsu zankpe ma uyio.
Surah 33:26   ,            And those of the People of the Book who aided them - Allah did take them down from their strongholds and cast terror into their hearts. (So that) some ye slew and some ye made prisoners.,Soko cia zanazhi jin kafirizhi taimako mini za ba litafizhio nan cin ke ekpoazhi lugwa U cia gan be kagboazhi ucia edo la'ashe yangban'azhi (Ebo wuncin'o) ye fe wu zandocizhi miniabo ye ma fe wan ndocizhi wuzhizhi.
Surah 33:27  ,          And He made you heirs of their lands their houses and their goods and of a land which ye had not frequented (before). And Allah has power over all things.,Soko cia kin yan'azhi to emiazhi to dukiyazhi gi-gun ya ye to kin ndoci otso nan bici yezhi laa pabo leanan (kpata wun'a laa gigun ya ye). Akika Soko gboka eti jin jin yandondo.
Surah 33:28    ,          O Prophet! Say to thy Consorts: "If it be that ye desire the life of this World and its glitter- then come! I will provide for your enjoyment and set you free in a handsome manner.,Ya wyoe Annabi a gan be yinmin wyozhi gan: Wun'ayi eman yizhe be eyan ninpauzhiy ga ye wa gan'o e da be Mia ya'e eman wo Mi ma gaa gan be yin gingan nan yi wangi nan.
Surah 33:29    ,         But if ye seek Allah and His Messenger and the Home of the Hereafter verily Allah has prepared for the well-doers amongst you a great reward.,Uma-yi Soko to Tuci'u to emi yan zoba wangi u ga ye wao akika Soko jin shiri yan egagba wanciko ya za kirikizhi mini yebo.
Surah 33:30      ,         O Consorts of the Prophet! If any of you were guilty of evident unseemly conduct the Punishment would be doubled to her and that is easy for Allah.,Ya ye yinmin Annabi zhi zaeni ndondo nan ga da lotun sakpa mini'ebo nan har ucia tula nan a ga azaba kpeba dozhi ya'a har guba jin-jin wuncin ma eyan finfanci uyi eba Soko bo.
Surah 33:31 ,            But any of you that is devout in the service of Allah and His Messenger and works righteousness- to her shall We grant her reward twice: and We have prepared for her a generous Sustenance.,Zaeni ndondo mini'ebo nan ga cin dan jin-jin ibadao ebo Soko be Tuci'u yin nan U cie kezhe lotun wangi wangizhi nan Yi ga lada'u la'ayau har zuguba Yi ma ga arziki nan wancin nan jin shiri ka'u.
Surah 33:32     ,             O Consorts of the Prophet! Ye are not like any of the (other) women: if ye do fear (Allah) be not too complacent of speech lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire: but speak ye a speech (that is) just.,Ya ye yinmin Annabi zhi akika Kinigiba ye U jin nini be yan ynzagi ndondo yin'a ye gae sundan Soko sun ga e ga fe kan bere nuwan eba egan gan'o ma har nan zandoci nan yi be batan yangban'ena wun'a de shahawa nan.

Surah 33:33  ,                      And stay quietly in your houses and make not a dazzling display like that of the former Times of Ignorance; and establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity; and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah only wishes to remove all abomination from you ye members of the Family and to make you pure and spotless.,Ye mae fedun efi emi yezhio ye mae ga fe dzun tinya kendoe gberi yan paayin zhi fe tinya nan-ma (dzun-dzun tinya be ninpae) Ye mae la sallah'e ku'e gikini Ye mae fe wa zakka dukiya yezhi ye mae fe gba Soko be Tuci'u yin.

Surah 33:34      ,       And recite what is rehearsed to you in your homes of the Signs of Allah and His Wisdom: for Allah understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted (with them).,Ye mae fe pa aya Soko nanzhi e gba wu ye emi ye zhio nan be Hadisizhiy. Akika Soko Etsu tosayi u yio Etsu kpikpe uyio.
Surah 33:35 ,                            For Muslim men and women- for believing men and women for devout men and women for true men and women for men and women who are patient and constant for men and women who humble themselves for men and women who give in Charity for men and women who fast (and deny themselves) for men and women who guard their chastity and for men and women who engage much in Allah´s praise- for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.,Akika Musulumi bagi to Musulumi ynzagizhi to Mumini bagizhi to Mumini ynzagizhi to bagi nanzhi acin dan ibada jin'o nan to ynzagi nanzhi a cin dan ibada jin'o nan to bagizhi nanzhi yi za gaskiyazhi nan to bagi nanzhi e jin hakuri nan to ynzagi nanzhi e jin hakurinan to bagi nanzhie dakpya nan to ynzagi nanzhie dakpya nan to bagi nanzhi ejin sadaka nan to ynzagi nanzhie jin sadaka na to bagi nanzhie fe azun nan to ynzagi nanzhie fe azun nan to bagi nanzhie tswa kaafaazhi nan to ynzagi nanzhie tswa kaafaazhi nan to bagi nanzhi e tun Soko ye dokun nan to ynzagi nanzhi gae tun Soko ye dokun nan (kpata'a) Soko jin shiri yan gafara be laada nan wancin nae yaa.
Surah 33:36          ,             It is not fitting for a Believer man or woman when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if any one disobeys Allah and His Messenger he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path.,U -- yin ya Mumini bagi to Mumini ynzagia kaminan Soko be Tuci'uyin ga hukunci ba eti alamari ndocio nan nan aada wa etsa ndoci ke alamari Soko lugwa na'a.

Surah 33:37         ,                                     Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thy favour: "Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife and fear Allah." But thou didst hide in thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her with the necessary (formality) We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And Allah´s command must be fulfilled.,Wyo mao pa kaminan wyo fe gan be za nan Soko jin ni'ima ya wyo tso ma jin ni'ima yanan gan: "A egwa sun yinmin'o wyo mao sundan Soko wyo mae so dan yangban wyo bo yan nan Soko gau tula nan wyo mae sundan zawangizhi Soko ga ma -- yin nan wyo'a sundan'u nao.

Surah 33:38         ,            There can be no difficulty to the Prophet in what Allah has indicated to him as a duty. It was the practice (approved) of Allah amongst those of old that have passed away. And the command of Allah is a decree determined.,Le fi ndondo ta ti Annabi boa mini yan nan Soko'ajin halali ya'una'a wuncin ma ekpa yan Soko uyio dan mini za nanzhi shidzo nao alamari Soko ma kadara uyio nan gaa fe nan.
Surah 33:39   ,         (It is the practice of those) who preach the Messages of Allah and fear Him and fear none but Allah. And enough is Allah to call (men) to account.,Za nanzhi e wu yan egan Soko nan a mae sundan u ke dansun zandoci lugwa nan akika Sokoa kunke yaa eba egagbao.
Surah 33:40       ,         Muhammad is not the father of any of your men but (he is) the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets: and Allah has full knowledge of all things.,(Annabi) Muhammadu fe nda ya zaeni ndondo mini bagi-ezhi boa ammade u yi Tuci Soko be emigun yan Annabizhiy. Akika Soko yi be kpikpe yandondoe.
Surah 33:41    ,  O ye who believe! Celebrate the praises of Allah and do this often;,Ya ye nanzhi a imani jin nan e fe tun Soko ye yetun nan dokun nan.
Surah 33:42  ,And glorify Him morning and evening.,Ye mae fe li'u tsa-tsayin to lazhin to lozun.
Surah 33:43    ,        He it is Who sends blessings on you as do His angels that He may bring you out from the depths of Darkness into Light: and He is Full of Mercy to the Believers.,Soko ga yi Etsu nae gun ye ye ganni be malaika'uzhiy nao ebo u la ye yiu wau dzun dagan bazhikozhio da haske akika ma Soko Etsu yegun U yio ya Muminizhi.
Surah 33:44,       Their salutation on the Day they meet Him will be "Peace!"; and He has prepared for them a generous Reward.,Emisaazhi fo nan a ga gun be Sokoe nan Ugayi salamu alaikum (emisa aminci) U ma kezhea shiri jin kaa yan lada nan wancin nan.
Surah 33:45 ,     O Prophet! Truly We have sent thee as a Witness a Bearer of Glad Tidings and Warner-,Ya wyoe Annabi! Akika Yi tun wyo tun'o ebo wyo la'o fe eri be za nan e ya labari yangbanfa (ya Muminizhi) nan be za nan e nan (kafirizhi) wun nan.
Surah 33:46,     And as one who invites to Allah´s (grace) by His leave and as a lamp spreading light.,Wyo ma'afe za nan e yi zazhi lo eko Soko be izini yan Sokoe nan ganni be fitila nan e ya haske nan.
Surah 33:47 ,      Then give the Glad Tidings to the Believers that they shall have from Allah a very great Bounty.,Wyo mao ya Muminizhi labari yangban-fa ke falala nan wancin nan a jin tabbata yaa dan nko yan Soko-na.
Surah 33:48     ,      And obey not (the behests) of the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites and heed not their annoyances but put thy Trust in Allah. For enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs.,Wyo mao ga lamitu kafirizhi to munafikizhi ma Wyo mao dzungan egun'azhio Wyo mao lao yaokpe Soko Soko ma'akunke nan'aya kpe'u nan.
Surah 33:49     ,                O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women and then divorce them before ye have touched them no period of ´Iddat have ye to count in respect of them: so give them a present. And set them free in a handsome manner.,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan!

Surah 33:50             ,                                               O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts who migrated (from Makka) with thee; and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her;- this only for thee and not for the Believers (at large); We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess;- in order that there should be no difficulty for thee. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.,Ya wyoe Annabi Akika yia yinmin wyo zhi nanzhi wyo ya sadaaki a nan la ajin halali ya wyoe to nanzhi egwa gwalo wye jin mulki nan mini ganima nanzhi Soko la ya wye to egi ynzagi yan ndagi wyozhi to egi ynzagi yan -- -- wyozhi nanzhi kpela (lo Madina) ganni be wyo yin nan to ynzagi ndondo nan ga miniu la ya Annabi nan Annabi otso gae wau eti yinmio nan nnan tso ma yi tsitsaci ya wye banbe Mumini nan ke nan zhiy.

Surah 33:51     ,                             Thou mayest defer (the turn of) any of them that thou pleasest and thou mayest receive any thou pleasest: and there is no blame on thee if thou invite one whose (turn) thou hadst set aside. This were nigher to the cooling of their eyes the prevention of their grief and their satisfaction - that of all of them - with that which thou hast to give them: and Allah knows (all) that is in your hearts: and Allah is All-Knowing Most Forbearing.,Na ga ba wyoe miniabo nan gangan u la'u pauta na ma ga ba wye nan uu dinba na wyoe ga ke wa mini nanzhi wyo gan a laa paatanan lefi danbo ya wyo yea.

Surah 33:52 ,                       It is not lawful for thee (to marry more) women after this nor to change them for (other) wives even though their beauty attract thee except any thy right hand should possess (as handmaidens): and Allah doth watch over all things.,Baaci (nnanzhiy) ynzagi ndocizhi ajin halali ya wyo yaa wyo mao ga san'agwa be ynzagi ndocizhi ma kaama esaazhi gae ya wyoe shahawa sai dai nan egwa gwalo wye ga jin mulki nan.

Surah 33:53                  ,                                                  O ye who believe! Enter not the Prophet´s houses- until leave is given you- for a meal (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation: but when ye are invited enter; and when ye have taken your meal disperse without seeking familiar talk. Such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet: he is ashamed to dismiss you but Allah is not ashamed (to tell you) the truth. And when ye ask (his ladies) for anything ye want ask them from before a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs. Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy Allah´s Messenger or that ye should marry his widows after him at any time.
