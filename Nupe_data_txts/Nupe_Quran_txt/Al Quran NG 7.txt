Surah 7:3 ,            Follow (O men!) the revelation given unto you from your Lord and follow not as friends or protectors other than Him.

Surah 7:5   ,        When (thus) Our punishment took them no cry did they utter but this: "Indeed we did wrong.",Gancin yandondo fe yanna fe tin ya misun'abo na'a saide afe gangan: "akika yi yia fe azwalumizhi.

Surah 7:10  ,        It is We Who have placed you with authority on earth and provided you therein with means for the fulfilment of your life: small are the thanks that ye give!,Akika ma Mia ye yakagbo dan kin bo Yicia eko yangici izhe wangizhi laafibo yaye. De'gi tsa ye ye jin yebo.
Surah 7:11  ,             It is We Who created you and gave you shape; then We bade the angels prostrate to Adam and they prostrate; not so Iblis; He refused to be of those who prostrate.,Akika ma Yia alitta ye jin gancin Yi cia ye ya siffa gancin Yici gan be malaikazhi gan: Ejin sujada ya Adama.

Surah 7:17     ,         "Then will I assault them from before them and behind them from their right and their left: Nor wilt thou find in most of them gratitude (for thy mercies).",Gancin ma akika mia fe dzun fia dagan yegboro a bo to dagan zumazhio to dagan gwaloazhio to dagan gwapin'zhio wyomaa tsun ekun dondoazhi ajin eza ye bo Sokozhia.

Surah 7:20,                        Then began Satan to whisper suggestions to them bringing openly before their minds all their shame that was hidden from them (before): he said: "Your Lord only forbade you this tree lest ye should become angels or such beings as live for ever.",Shetan ci swo egan dede loa yangban'o ebo u'la sutura na fan na kan'abo ci kan yavun'a na-uku'u ya uci gan: Ujin yandondo la Tsoci ye ci kan ye cigban nana yin gia saide ebo yebea azhe malaikazhi ma-ko ma ebo yebe fie bo be za nazhia fibo tutun yin nama.
Surah 7:21,    And he swore to them both that he was their sincere adviser.,Uci zhi kutiya zagubaba: Akika mide dan mini gangba jinci zhio ya ye.
Surah 7:22 ,                          So by deceit he brought about their fall: when they tasted of the tree their shame became manifest to them and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies. And their Lord called unto them: "Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you that Satan was an avowed enemy unto you",Uci tagwa wuaba be etae.

Surah 7:26    ,              O ye Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover your shame as well as to be an adornment to you. But the raiment of righteousness- that is the best. Such are among the Signs of Allah that they may receive admonition!Ya ye egi Adamuzhi! Akika  Yicin tufuwa be ya ye na ga kpe yavun yezhi na uma yi ninpa be. Tufuwa yan dasun Soko ma wyunga de alheri gan'o wuncin ma dan mini aya Soko zhio uijn-wo be wuncin'y a gaa santu.
Surah 7:27                             O ye Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you in the same manner as He got your parents out of the Garden stripping them of their raiment to expose their shame: for he and his tribe watch you from a position where ye cannot see them: We made the evil ones friends (only) to those without faith.,Ya ye egi Adamu zhi! Ega lugwa shetan jin'e fitina ma kendoe ujin ucia yanmanci ye gubaba kutin ya dagan aljannao na ufe fan'a tufuwa'a ya zagubaba ebo u'la yavun'azhiu lau wua zagubaba.

Surah 7:28            ,         When they do aught that is shameful they say: "We found our fathers doing so"; and "Allah commanded us thus": Say: "Nay Allah never commands what is shameful: do ye say of Allah what ye know not",Ama gada lo' tun swakwa (Alfasha).

Surah 7:29   ,            Say: "My Lord hath commanded justice; and that ye set your whole selves (to Him) at every time and place of prayer and call upon Him making your devotion sincere as in His sight: such as He created you in the beginning so shall ye return.",Gan gan: Tsoci mi jin (Yi ) foro jin be gboro dae (adalinci) : ye mae la fuska ye (nakan kpace yezhi) zhie kue gikini danna salla ndondo ye mae la adinie li-e yau tsatsayin kendoe ma uca jin jin alittaye na acinga yea zheban da tsun wyun'o.
Surah 7:30     ,          Some He hath guided: Others have (by their choice) deserved the loss of their way; in that they took the evil ones in preference to Allah for their friends and protectors and think that they receive guidance.,Jama'a ndocizhi danbo (Soko) awu ba ndoci ma danbo egbin'ajin tabbata ta etiabo. Akika a shetanzhi la Ndakatazhi zunma yan Soko Acie le ye gan akika ezabawuzhi ayio na.
Surah 7:31    ,          O Children of Adam! wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of prayer: eat and drink: But waste not by excess for Allah loveth not the wasters.,Yaye egi Adamuzhi!

Surah 7:32       ,                  Say: Who hath forbidden the beautiful (gifts) of Allah which He hath produced for His servants and the things clean and pure (which He hath provided) for sustenance Say: They are in the life of this world for those who believe (and) purely for them on the Day of Judgment. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for those who understand.Gangan: ,Ngba zi' ila eyan ninpa yan Soko na ula tin ya ebo (anfani) wuzhiuzhio na jin haramu to yangici lilicizhi dagan mini yan arzikiubo Gangan: "Ngan yan zanazhia imani jin na ayio dan edun fe yizhe bo uma gazhe tsitsaciya'a Efo Alkiyami. Acinga ga yie kpe ayazhi yeo ya jama'a nazhi ga de kpikpe nao".
Surah 7:33     ,                       Say: the things that my Lord hath indeed forbidden are: shameful deeds whether open or secret; sins and trespasses against truth or reason; assigning of partners to Allah for which He hath given no authority; and saying things about Allah of which ye have no knowledge.,Gangan: "Akika de tsoci mi yin'a eyan swakwazhi kpata la'azhe haramu to nazhi tula miniabo na to nazhia swo na to zunubi jin to ragbanzhi nadan tsunwan gaskiya boa na ye mae ga la yandoci  aa pa Soko baci nama ucin hujja ndondo be etiuboa-nama ye mae gafe ganagan ta Soko na yekpe hakika wun'a nama
Surah 7:34  ,        To every people is a term appointed: when their term is reached not an hour can they cause delay nor (an hour) can they advance (it in anticipation),Aluma ndondo ma ude ekpe ta bau ekpe taba (ajali) yan ndondoa maga dabe a pata ya'a ka yan lokaci ninia ama la'a lo ye gboroa.
Surah 7:35  ,               O ye Children of Adam! whenever there come to you messengers from amongst you rehearsing My signs unto you- those who are righteous and mend (their lives)- on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.,Ya ye egi Adamu zhi!

Surah 7:36,         But those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance- they are companions of the Fire to dwell therein (for ever).,Zanazhi-maaya Yizhi yi ganmana na acia gbotika kea lugwa na zawuncinzhi ga yi egi mi na zhi bagabo ma afi tutun yin'o.
Surah 7:37  ,                                  Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Signs For such their portion appointed must reach them from the Book (of decrees): until when our messengers (of death) arrive and take their souls they say: "Where are the things that ye used to invoke besides Allah" They will reply "They have left us in the lurch" And they will bear witness against themselves that they had rejected Allah.T,o Ngba zi'i ga ti binakun a gan yan zana da tswa ganmana cia ta Soko nao ko ma ucia aya Soko Zhi yi ganmana nao Za iri na na zhi ayi be kinigi ba yin (yan arziki izhe) dan mini litafio har da lokaci na Tuci Yizhi ga be eba'ciagwo rayi bea yin nan acia gan gan: babo yannazhi ye wun zunma Soko na dan'o Acia gangan: A'ya ke yi lugwa atso ciga eri ya ta eti tacin'atso ke de aya'afe kafirizhi na.
Surah 7:38  ,                                     He will say: "Enter ye in the company of the peoples who passed away before you - men and jinns - into the Fire." Every time a new people enters it curses its sister-people (that went before) until they follow each other all into the Fire. Saith the last about the first: "Our Lord! it is these that misled us: so give them a double penalty in the Fire." He will say: "Doubled for all" : but this ye do not understand.,Ugan: Eda gadan alunmanazhi gwogan shi yedzo dan mini aljanizhio to zawangizhi aci fi mini enao na.

Surah 7:40 ,                     To those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance no opening will there be of the gates of heaven nor will they enter the garden until the camel can pass through the eye of the needle: Such is Our reward for those in sin.,Akika zanazhia aya Mi zhi yi ganmana na acia gbotika ke u lugwa na a kpe eko Aljannazhi ya aa ama'ade Aljanna gandan'a (sai de) har da kamina rakum ga lodan misun ekin'o wo na Acinga gama Yie wo lefi jincizhi gbatao.

Surah 7:42 ,             But those who believe and work righteousness- no burden do We place on any soul but that which it can bear- they will be Companions of the Garden therein to dwell (for ever).,Zanazhi ma' imani jin na acie lotun wangizhi na Yie la kpaka a ta rayia sai yan yanna ugajin wona zawuncizhi ga yi za'mi Aljannazhio ama'afibofi tuntunyin.
Surah 7:43,                                   And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury;- beneath them will be rivers flowing;- and they shall say: "Praise be to Allah who hath guided us to this (felicity): never could we have found guidance had it not been for the guidance of Allah: indeed it was the truth that the messengers of our Lord brought unto us." And they shall hear the cry: "Behold! the garden before you!

Surah 7:44  ,                         The Companions of the Garden will call out to the Companions of the Fire: "We have indeed found the promises of our Lord to us true: Have you also found Your Lord´s promises true" They shall say "Yes"; but a crier shall proclaim between them: "The curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers;-,Egi mi Aljannazhi cia ta mi yi egi mi nazhi gan: "Akika yannazhi Tsoci yi jinyi Alkawali na yia de (kpata) be gaskiyae ngba  yannazhi tsociye jin ye Alkawali na ye tsun'u acin be gaskiyae Acigan: E- zanae yami na ci ya'mi tsakaniabo ci gan: "Emibo yan Soko ajin tabbata ta eti azwalumizhio.

Surah 7:46  ,               Between them shall be a veil and on the heights will be men who would know every one by his marks: they will call out to the Companions of the Garden "peace on you": they will not have entered but they will have an assurance (thereof).,Yekan ndoci ma dan tsakaniabo be dozhi eti pati yan A'arafuoma eza bagi ndoci kpebo akpe (egi mi Aljanna to egi mi nazhi ye) be alama'azhi: Aci yi egi mi Aljannazhigan: Aminci (Soko) ula'ujin tabbata u ya ye: Ala'a de gandan boa ama'ade ejin fan fan yan gingandan.
Surah 7:47 ,           When their eyes shall be turned towards the Companions of the Fire they will say: "Our Lord! send us not to the company of the wrong-doers.",Ama ga eyeazhi pan da'eba egi minazhi a gan: Tsociyi! Ga la yi fe dan baenio be jama'a yan azwalumizhi ma.

Surah 7:50  ,                 The Companions of the Fire will call to the Companions of the Garden: "Pour down to us water or anything that Allah doth provide for your sustenance." They will say: "Both these things hath Allah forbidden to those who rejected Him.",Egimi nazhi cia ta mi yi egi "mi Aljannazhi gan: "E to nuwan kpeyi ko ma yandoci dagan mini arziki na Soko ya ye nao agan" Akika Sokoa gubaba la' jin haramu ya kafirizhi.
Surah 7:51,                  "Such as took their religion to be mere amusement and play and were deceived by the life of the world." That day shall We forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs and as they were wont to reject Our signs.,Zanazhia adinia zhi la eyan shagala be edzoe na rayuwa yan yizhe cia ta (ke Soko lugwa na.) to Yiga atso batan kendoe atso ba efo gungun'a yan yinna tan na to ayayi nazhi afe gbomi be yin na.

Surah 7:53  ,                                   Do they just wait for the final fulfilment of the event On the day the event is finally fulfilled those who disregarded it before will say: "The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring true (tidings). Have we no intercessors now to intercede on our behalf Or could we be sent back then should we behave differently from our behaviour in the past." In fact they will have lost their souls and the things they invented will leave them in the lurch.,Kashi e ka yandoci ka na'ayi bayani yan gbangba eti alkiyamio na fondondo na bayani yan gbangba ga be ya'a na zanazhi'u batan shidzo batsozhio na agangan: "Akika Tuci yan Tsoci yizhi be be gaskiyae.

Surah 7:56 ,             Do no mischief on the earth after it hath been set in order but call on Him with fear and longing (in your hearts): for the Mercy of Allah is (always) near to those who do good.,Ye mae ga nyin yan fi kinbo ba ci yan edzutau bo ma.

Surah 7:57  ,                          It is He Who sendeth the winds like heralds of glad tidings going before His mercy: when they have carried the heavy-laden clouds We drive them to a land that is dead make rain to descend thereon and produce every kind of harvest therewith: thus shall We raise up the dead: perchance ye may remember.,Wyun ga mae tun efe zhi tun'o ebo ula labari yangbanfa yan yegun Soko nadan yegboro na'u yaye harda kamina uga girgije zhi la ucia lukpin na Yici gau dagwa da ezhi nayi tsutsuci na.Yicia du le zhin beuyin yicia la yangici sunsunzhi iri ndondo tinya be'uyin.

Surah 7:58,                From the land that is clean and good by the will of its Cherisher springs up produce (rich) after its kind: but from the land that is bad springs up nothing but that which is niggardly: thus do we explain the signs by various (symbols) to those who are grateful.,Ezhi na ma yi wangi na yangici sunsun'uzhi ga tinya be izini Tsociuyin ezhi nama ga'a nyin-na Yangici sunsun'u wun'atinya'a sai be wahalae.

Surah 7:131  ,                   But when good (times) came they said "This is due to us;" When gripped by calamity they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him! Behold! in truth the omens of evil are theirs in Allah´s sight but most of them do not understand!,Gancin ma alheri ndoci ga'a dea:agan: Nana yan yi uyio Eyan de de maga tswan'a agan: Musa tsa jin'a efuo to wyin to zanazhi pama beu yin na!

Surah 7:133  ,          So We sent (plagues) on them: Wholesale death Locusts Lice Frogs And Blood: Signs openly self-explained: but they were steeped in arrogance- a people given to sin.,Yici tun azaba yan tufanu (na fewua na) fia to eyan fufungizhi to kwokwota to tankpolo zhi to egya: ayazhi na zhi yi kaka yin-na; acia gbotika acia fe jama nazhi yi le fi jin ci zhi na.
Surah 7:134 ,                    Every time the penalty fell on them they said: "O Moses! on your behalf call on thy Lord in virtue of his promise to thee: If thou wilt remove the penalty from us we shall truly believe in thee and we shall send away the Children of Israel with thee.",Kamina masiba bea cin ta'a na aci gan:"Ya Musa!

Surah 7:135  ,        But every time We removed the penalty from them according to a fixed term which they had to fulfil- Behold! they broke their word!,To kamina yi bea masiba wuncin la keyabo ya'yan lokaci degi na kanga gancin acia fe zanazhie lo al kawa li ya na.
Surah 7:136 ,         So We exacted retribution from them: We drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our Signs and failed to take warning from them.,Yici jin azaba yan egagba yicia gbin fi mini eduo ebo na hakika a aya Yizhi yi ganmana. Acia fe zanazhia ya-ye keu lugwa na.
Surah 7:137  ,                          And We made a people considered weak (and of no account) inheritors of lands in both east and west - lands whereon We sent down Our blessings. The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they had patience and constancy and We levelled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected (with such pride).,Yicia Banu israila zhi la'azhe edu tu aci da gun be jama'a ndoci nazhia gi ba wun wun yan ku ti azhi na aci gan: Ya wyoe Musa!

Surah 7:138 ,                     We took the Children of Israel (with safety) across the sea. They came upon a people devoted entirely to some idols they had. They said: "O Moses! fashion for us a god like unto the gods they have." He said: "Surely ye are a people without knowledge.,Yicia Banu Israila zhi la'azhe edu tu aci da gun be jama'a ndoci nazhia gi ba wun wun yan ku ti azhi na aci gan: Ya wyoe Musa!

Surah 7:142 ,                     We appointed for Moses thirty nights and completed (the period) with ten (more): thus was completed the term (of communion) with his Lord forty nights. And Moses had charged his brother Aaron (before he went up): "Act for me amongst my people: Do right and follow not the way of those who do mischief.",Yima jin Musa alkawali nya yeshi gbanwo Yi cia gunmi be (efo) guwoe gancin lokaci yan Tsociu (beuyin) cia gunmi dan yeshi shibao.

Allah said: "By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place then shalt thou see Me." When his Lord manifested His glory on the Mount He made it as dust. And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: "Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance and I am the first to believe.",Kamina Musa be mi'kati yi na Tsociu cigan be uyin Musa cigan: ya wyoe Tsoci mi!

Surah 7:146 ,                                  Those who behave arrogantly on the earth in defiance of right - them will I turn away from My signs: Even if they see all the signs they will not believe in them; and if they see the way of right conduct they will not adopt it as the way; but if they see the way of error that is the way they will adopt. For they have rejected our signs and failed to take warning from them.,Mi ga za nazhie gbotika ta eti kinbo umayi be haki ndondo yin'ana pan ya ke aya Mi zhi lugwa.

Surah 7:148  ,                   The people of Moses made in his absence out of their ornaments the image of calf (for worship): it seemed to low: did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor show them the way They took it for worship and they did wrong.,Jama'a yan Musa zhi cia nanko la dagan mini eyan ninpa'azhio aciu sa nakan kpace naetiwu (dozhin nanko na).

Aaron said: "Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune nor count thou me amongst the people of sin.",Kamina ma Musa dazhin eba jama'a yan'uzhi na wyun'afe zana'a zhewun uma' nyin yangban na.

Surah 7:160,                                          We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: "Strike the rock with thy staff": out of it there gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds and sent down to them manna and quails (saying): "Eat of the good things We have provided for you": (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm but they harmed their own souls.,Yicia sa fi "sibti" (ezhimi ko kin) guwo be gubae alunmazhi.

Surah 7:163  ,                        Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them openly holding up their heads but on the day they had no Sabbath they came not: thus did We make a trial of them for they were given to transgression.,Wyo mao gbin'agan labari alkarya wuncin na ci kpata misun'ona kamina afe -- iyaka gan eti (hukunci) efo Asibio na (Sokoa ikan wan la'azhe haramu ya'a asibi foe) kanga ma ikan'azhi ciaajin afe tin ya gu ra rae.

Surah 7:168   ,          We broke them up into sections on this earth. There are among them some that are the righteous and some that are the opposite.

Surah 7:169   ,                                    After them succeeded an (evil) generation: They inherited the Book but they chose (for themselves) the vanities of this world saying (for excuse): "(Everything) will be forgiven us." (Even so) if similar vanities came their way they would (again) seize them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth and they study what is in the Book. But best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter.

Surah 7:171       ,           When We shook the Mount over them as if it had been a canopy and they thought it was going to fall on them (We said): "Hold firmly to what We have given you and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein; perchance ye may fear Allah.",To kamina Yi la pati tu ta eti'abo na wyo cia ye gan ko girgije uyio aci fe kpaye ke de hakika uga'a kpankpea na (aci gan 'agan): yea egwa sun yan na Yi la ya ye na be kagboe ye mae fepa yan na zhi fi bo na ujin wo be wuncin'y ye ga fe za na zhie tswa Soko acie sun dan'una.

Surah 7:176    ,                         If it had been Our will We should have elevated him with Our signs; but he inclined to the earth and followed his own vain desires. His similitude is that of a dog: if you attack him he lolls out his tongue or if you leave him alone he (still) lolls out his tongue. That is the similitude of those who reject Our signs; So relate the story; perchance they may reflect.,Uma ga ba Yi ba da Yi gau la'atu be aya wuncin zhi amma de wyun tso egba wa dan kin bo ucia emi tu etun yan gban'u koton ci yan za wuncin wun'afe ke koton ci eshigi na wyo ga wa'u wun ufe ce gin tara ka wyo ma gau ya yan'u wun'afe ce gintara na na ga yi koton ci yan jama'a nazhia aya Soko zhi yi gan ma nao: gba etan (labari) na na ya'a ujin wo be wuncin'y aga fe za na zhiekpa ye na.

Surah 7:179   ,                          Many are the Jinns and men we have made for Hell: They have hearts wherewith they understand not eyes wherewith they see not and ears wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle- nay more misguided: for they are heedless (of warning).,Hakika ma yi jin alittazhi ebo jahannamao nazhi dokun na mini aljanizhio to zawan gi zhio ayi be yan gban zhi egan zhi mae yea ama yi be eye zhiamae la'a le ba yea ama yi be tukpa zhi amae la'a wo gan'a: zawuncin zhi ke dabba zhi na ayio.

Surah 7:180        ,     The most beautiful names belong to Allah: so call on him by them; but shun such men as use profanity in his names: for what they do they will soon be requited.,Soko ma yi be sunna wan gi zhi ebo acin'o efebau yan be a yin ye mae dzun gan zana zhie nyin sunna Soko zhi ya nao: Be le yin aga'agba be iri etun nazhie lo na.

Surah 7:183,    Respite will I grant unto them: for My scheme is strong (and unfailing).,Mimae pata pa ya'a hakika tangi tso yan Mi ugbo ka sarau yin .
Surah 7:184    ,      Do they not reflect Their companion is not seized with madness: he is but a perspicuous warner.,Kashi akpa ye kpa'a ngan batan yan iladzun udan be maso yia yin'a hakika ufea sai de gan gba jin ci na;a tu la na.
Surah 7:185,                     Do they see nothing in the government of the heavens and the earth and all that Allah hath created (Do they not see) that it may well be that their terms is nigh drawing to an end In what message after this will they then believe,Kashi acin le lo eba mulki yan sanmazhi to kin yin'a to iri yandondo na Soko jin jin na'a uma jin wo gan ajali azhie la'a tso ba ni  To egan ki ci baci wuncin'o ke na yea jin imani be yin nao
Surah 7:186,         To such as Allah rejects from His guidance there can be no guide: He will leave them in their trespasses wandering in distraction.,Zaeni ndondo na Soko gau gbin na ade zan dondo na'a lau kr eko wo na'a uci ga'a ya gun egbin'azhio eza zhi zhi ci zhi.
Surah 7:187,                                    They ask thee about the (final) Hour - when will be its appointed time Say: "The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (alone): None but He can reveal as to when it will occur. Heavy were its burden through the heavens and the earth. Only all of a sudden will it come to you." They ask thee as if thou Wert eager in search thereof: Say: "The knowledge thereof is with Allah (alone) but most men know not.",Egbin wyo gan eti eka yan ekin na kiyamao foci wun'ajin tabbattao Gan gan: hakika de kpi kpeu dan be tso ci mi yin.

Surah 7:189  ,                          It is He Who created you from a single person and made his mate of like nature in order that he might dwell with her (in love). When they are united she bears a light burden and carries it about (unnoticed). When she grows heavy they both pray to Allah their Lord (saying): "If Thou givest us a goodly child we vow we shall (ever) be grateful.",Wyun ga yi Etsu na jin alitta ye dagan rayi ninio na Ucia yiwo jin yau dagan minia tso ebo ude bau fa yangban'u dan miniubo.
