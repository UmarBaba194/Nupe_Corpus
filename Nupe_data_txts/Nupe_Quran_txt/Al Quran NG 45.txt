Surah 45:1 ,Ha-Mim.,HEU MIM
Surah 45:2  ,   The revelation of the Book is from Allah the Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom.,Cin cin yan Litafi nan nan dagan eba Soko bo u fe beo Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima.
Surah 45:3     ,Verily in the heavens and the earth are Signs for those who believe.,Akika mini sanmazhio to kin ayazhi danbo ya Muminizhi.
Surah 45:4 ,       And in the creation of yourselves and the fact that animals are scattered (through the earth) are Signs for those of assured Faith.,To mini alitta ye zhio to mini dabba nanzhiy ga kpe kinbo nan ayazhi danbo ya jamaa nanzhia gaskiya ya nan.
Surah 45:5      ,             And in the alternation of Night and Day and the fact that Allah sends down Sustenance from the sky and revives therewith the earth after its death and in the change of the winds- are Signs for those that are wise.,To egwasan yan yeshi be batin'y to arziki nanzhiy Soko cin beyn dagan sanmao nan Ucia kin tsutsuci dan rayi nan to mini efe nae ti ucie je za nan kpata ayazhi danbo ya jama'a nanzhi ga yi be ankaliy nan.
Surah 45:6    ,       Such are the Signs of Allah which We rehearse to thee in Truth; then in what exposition will they believe after (rejecting) Allah and His Signs,Wuncinzhi kpata ayazhi ayio yan Soko Yi mae gba'agba ya wye be gaskiyae. Ngba zunma yan Soko be ayauzhiy (ka gan ye ya gaskiya be'a yin'a) egan kici a ya gaskiya be yin beo
Surah 45:7 ,  Woe to each sinful dealer in Falsehoods:,Azaba yan robonkpe wun'ajin tabbata ya zaeni ndondo na gae zun ganmanan tsuru nan u ma yi lefi jinci nan.
Surah 45:8   ,          He hears the Signs of Allah rehearsed to him yet is obstinate and lofty as if he had not heard them: then announce to him a Penalty Grievous!,Wun'e wo nae gba aya Soko zhi ya'u nan gancin uci ga' tu-ta eti etikagbo ufe jin bojin ke zanae wo gan'a nan e yau labari be azabae nan yi tintanci nan.
Surah 45:9 ,         And when he learns something of Our Signs he takes them in jest: for such there will be a humiliating Penalty.,Uma ga kpikpe ndoci de dagan mini aya Yizhio' wun'u la eyan edzo akika zawuncinzhi azaba yan zunyesun u ga'jin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 45:10  ,                In front of them is Hell: and of no profit to them is anything they may have earned nor any protectors they may have taken to themselves besides Allah: for them is a tremendous Penalty.,Enan yan jahannama danbo e ka'a yan nanzhiy ma a de kuyekan izheo nan wun'a kunke yaa eko ndondo boa to zandocizhi nanzhiy a la egwasun ke ndakatazhi nan( a' kunke ya' eko ndondo boa) azaba na ma wancin nan wun'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 45:11 ,         This is (true) Guidance and for those who reject the Signs of their Lord is a grievous Penalty of abomination.,(Alkuranu) Nan nan bawu uyio za nanzhiy ma ajin kafirinci be aya Tsocia zhiy nan azaba nan de nangban uma tan nan wun'ajin tabbata yaa.
Surah 45:12,             It is Allah Who has subjected the sea to you that ships may sail through it by His command that ye may seek of his Bounty and that ye may be grateful.,Soko ga yi Etsu nan jin eduzhi foro ya yeo nao ebo eya nuwanzhi a fea dazan'ata etiubo be kagbo yan Sokoe ebo ma ye fe wa arziki yan Sokoe za be wuncin'y ma ye lae fe za nanzhie jin yebo ya Soko nan.
Surah 45:12  ,           It is Allah Who has subjected the sea to you that ships may sail through it by His command that ye may seek of his Bounty and that ye may be grateful.,Soko ga yi Etsu nan jin eduzhi foro ya yeo nao ebo eya nuwanzhi a fea dazan'ata etiubo be kagbo yan Sokoe ebo ma ye fe wa arziki yan Sokoe za be wuncin'y ma ye lae fe za nanzhie jin yebo ya Soko nan.
Surah 45:13  ,             And He has subjected to you as from Him all that is in the heavens and on earth: Behold in that are Signs indeed for those who reflect.,U ma'a yannanzhiy fi sanmazhio nan to nan zhiy fi kinbo nan jin foro ya ye baenio dagan nko u bo akika mini wuncinzhio a'yazhi danbo ya za nanzhiy gae kpaye nan.
Surah 45:14     ,        Tell those who believe to forgive those who do not look forward to the Days of Allah: It is for Him to recompense (for good or ill) each People according to what they have earned.,Gan ya za nanzhia imani jin nan gan a'fa be za nanzhiy e jin kauna yan egagba wangi dan efo yan Soko (zhi) boa nan. Ebo nan Soko ga zawangizhi wo gbata be iri etun nanzhiy a ga lo nan.
Surah 45:15    ,      If any one does a righteous deed it ensures to the benefit of his own soul; if he does evil it works against (his own soul). In the end will ye (all) be brought back to your Lord.,Za nan ga lo etun wangi nan ebo tiu bo za na ma ga lo 'tun dede nan wuntso ga wun'a wu yan yao gancin eba Tsoci ye ga yea kezhe lo.
Surah 45:16    ,        We did aforetime grant to the Children of Israel the Book the Power of Command and Prophethood; We gave them for Sustenance things good and pure; and We favoured them above the nations.,Akika Yi ya Litafi to hukunci to Annabci la'a ya Banu Israilazhi Yi ma yaa arziki wangizhi Yi maa ya daraja ta eti alittazhio.
Surah 45:17     ,                  And We granted them Clear Signs in affairs (of Religion): it was only after knowledge had been granted to them that they fell into schisms through insolent envy among themselves. Verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment as to those matters in which they set up differences.,Yi ma la hujjazhi be ya'a nanzhia tula nan eti alamari adinio. Ama ce dozhi leba'a sai de baci nan kpikpe da be ya'a nan ebo nanvo (hassada) nan dan tsakaniabo be dozhiy nan. Akika Tsoci wye ga hukunci ba tsakaniabo efo alkiyamiy eti yan nanzhie la ce le ba be dozhiy nan.
Surah 45:18    ,        Then We put thee on the (right) Way of Religion: so follow thou that (Way) and follow not the desires of those who know not.,Gancin Yicia wyo la'a ta eti ekp yan sharia yan alamari adinio ebo acin'o a'mi tu'u wyo mao ga la mi tu etun yangban yan za nanzhi de kpikpea na ma.
Surah 45:19   ,           They will be of no use to thee in the sight of Allah: it is only Wrong-doers (that stand as) protectors one to another: but Allah is the Protector of the Righteous.,Akika a kunke ya wye wo be yandondoe naa be dagan eba Soko naa akika ma azwalumizhi masoyizhi ayi be dozhi yin'o Soko ga ma yi Ndakata yan za nanzhie sundan'u nao.
Surah 45:20  ,    These are clear evidences to men and a Guidance and Mercy to those of assured Faith.,Alkur'anu nan nan hujjazhi uyi ya zawangizhio ganni be bawu'y be yegun'y ya jama'a nanzhia gaskiya ya nao.
Surah 45:21  ,              What! Do those who seek after evil ways think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous deeds- that equal will be their life and their death Ill is the judgment that they make.,Kashi za nanzhie lo tun dede nan e kpayekpa gan Yi la'a ya afe yeni be za nanzhia imani jin amae lo tun guru nan a laazhe yeni to eba edunfe izheo be eba ajaliy (Wun'ayi acinga ga e kpa yeo) akika hukunci wuncin wun'a biye.
Surah 45:22   ,         Allah created the heavens and the earth for just ends and in order that each soul may find the recompense of what it has earned and none of them be wronged.,Soko ma alitta yan sanmazhi to kin jin be gaskiyae. Ebo ma a'ga zandondo gba be iri etun nan u ga lo nae ama'a jin'a zwaluncia.
Surah 45:23          ,             Then seest thou such a one as takes as his god his own vain desire Allah has knowing (him as such) left him astray and sealed his hearing and his heart (and understanding) and put a cover on his sight. Who then will guide him after Allah (has withdrawn Guidance) Will ye not then receive admonition,Ngba wyo le za naa etun yangban'u la tsociunan yea Soko ciu gbin eti kpikpeo U ciu tukpa to yangban'ute Ucia kpere la'a kpe'u ba ye leu bo. Ngba ziy'a wu za nan nan ba wo baci Soko bo Kashi ye kpa ye kpaa
Surah 45:24   ,                 And they say: "What is there but our life in this world We shall die and we live and nothing but time can destroy us." But of that they have no knowledge: they merely conjecture:,Aci gan: yandondo danboa izhe le tsa'u yio yi gaatsu yi ma gaa ye rayi de yandondo ma'ajin-yi hallaka sai de za'mam. Ade kpikpe yan akika eti wuncin boa ama de yan nan e jin na'a sai de zato.
Surah 45:25     ,          And when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them their argument is nothing but this: They say "Bring (back) our forefathers if what ye say is true!",Kamina ma a gae gba aya yi zhi yaa be bayaniy nan e de hujja ndondoa sai de a gan gan: E la yanmanci yizhi nanzhia tsuani na be yi le'a ye wun'ayi gaskiya ye tao nan.
Surah 45:26    ,             Say: "It is Allah Who gives you life then gives you death; then He will gather you together for the Day of Judgment about which there is no doubt": But most men do not understand.,Gan gan: Soko gae dan rayi umaa kezhe a ye wu gancin uci gae ku yekan efo alkiyamiy kelo kezhin ndondo danboa amma'de ekun dondo zawangizhi akpea.
Surah 45:27 ,        To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and the Day that the Hour of Judgment is established- that Day will the dealers in Falsehood perish!,Akika Soko ga wun mulki yan sanmazhi to kin bo efo nan alkiyami gaa nan nan fo wuncin ganmana zuncizhi ga'ajin asara.
Surah 45:28    ,         And thou wilt see every sect bowing the knee: Every sect will be called to its Record: "This Day shall ye be recompensed for all that ye did!,Wyo ma'ale al'umma ndondo ye ci kurao (ta eti vokpaa bo). Acia yi alumma ndondo lo eba Litafiu. Yinnan'nnan aa'ga ye gba yan etun nanzhiy ye fe lo (izheo) nan.
Surah 45:29     ,     "This Our Record speaks about you with truth: For We were wont to put on Record all that ye did.",Nan nan Litafi Yi uyio wun'e gan gan eti yebo be gaskiyae akika Yi yaafe yi fe ka etun nanzhiy ye fe lo nan.
Surah 45:30     ,       Then as to those who believed and did righteous deeds their Lord will admit them to His Mercy that will be the achievement for all to see.,Ammade za nanzhi ga imani jin acie lo tun wangizhi nan Tsoci'a gaala gandan mini yegun'u bo wuncin ga yi rabo nan latu nao.
Surah 45:31     ,      But as to those who rejected Allah (to them will be said): "Were not Our Signs rehearsed to you But ye were arrogant and were a people given to sin!,Za nanzhiy ma ajin kafirinci nan (a gan'a gan:) Asa afe gba aya Mizhi ya ye yea Ye cia gbotika ye cia fe za nanzhie jin lefi (kpe kinbo) nan.
Surah 45:32   ,                  "And when it was said that the promise of Allah was true and that the Hour- there was no doubt about its (coming) ye used to say ´We know not what is the hour: we only think it is an idea and we have no firm assurance.´",A ma ga gan'a gan: Akika alkawali yan Soko gaskiya uyio alkiyami ma kelo kezhin ndondo danboa Ye gan: Yi kpe yan naotso e ye alkiyami naa yi de ejin zatto jin kawanyin yi ya gaskiya beu yin'a.
Surah 45:33    ,      Then will appear to them the evil (fruits) of what they did and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!,Egagba yan etun dede nanzhiy a lo nan cia tula ya'a yannan a fe la a lami nan cia jin tabbata ta etiabo.
Surah 45:34   ,          It will also be said: "This Day We will forget you as ye forgot the meeting of this Day of yours! and your abode is the Fire and no helpers have ye!,Aci a gan'a gan: Yinnan nan nan Yi ga ye batan kendoe ye tsoa efo gun-gun yan ye be efo alkiyami nan batan nan ezhe kebae ma u ga yi enao ye maade za nanzhia jin'e taimako na'a.
Surah 45:35    ,           "This because ye used to take the Signs of Allah in jest and the life of the world deceived you:" (From) that Day therefore they shall not be taken out thence nor shall they be received into Grace.,Wuncin mayi ebo nan ye yaa aya Soko zhi la edzo nan edunfe yan izhe cia ye ta yinnannnan a kua tinya enan boa amma lugwa ade uzuri ndondo ta'a.
Surah 45:36  ,     Then Praise be to Allah Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth- Lord and Cherisher of all the Worlds!,Yebo kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu nan yi Tsoci yan sanmazhi to kin nan Etsu nae kpa alittazhi kpata nan.
Surah 45:37   ,    To Him be glory throughout the heavens and the earth: and He is Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom!,Elatu be kagbo yan baeni maajin tabbata ya Soko dan sanmanzhio to kin bo. Soko ga ma yi etsu zankpeo Etsu nan yi Etsu hikima nan.
