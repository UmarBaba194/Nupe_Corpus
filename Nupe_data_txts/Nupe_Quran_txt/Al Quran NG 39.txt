Surah 39:3  ,                              Is it not to Allah that sincere devotion is due But those who take for protectors other than Allah (say): "We only serve them in order that they may bring us nearer to Allah."

Surah 39:5   ,                   He created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): He makes the Night overlap the Day and the Day overlap the Night: He has subjected the sun and the moon (to His law): Each one follows a course for a time appointed. Is not He the Exalted in Power - He Who forgives again and again,Wun'a alitta yan sanmazhi to kin jin be gaskiyae wyun'e la yeshi fan a la kpe igidi umae la igidi fan kpe yeshio.

Surah 39:6  ,                                 He created you (all) from a single person: then created of like nature his mate; and he sent down for you eight head of cattle in pairs: He makes you in the wombs of your mothers in stages one after another in three veils of darkness. such is Allah your Lord and Cherisher: to Him belongs (all) dominion.

Surah 39:20     ,              But it is for those who fear their Lord.
