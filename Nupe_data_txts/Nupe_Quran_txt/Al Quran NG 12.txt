Surah 12:57 ,     But verily the reward of the Hereafter is the best for those who believe and are constant in righteousness.,Hakika ma egagba yan Alkiyami ude alheri gan ya zanazhi ga imani jin na acia fe za nazhie tswa Soko a mae sundan'u na.
Surah 12:58  ,      Then came Joseph´s brethren: they entered his presence and he knew them but they knew him not.,Yegi Yusufu zhi ci dabe acia gandan ebaubo ucia dza tin ammade a lau be woa.
Surah 12:59   ,             And when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them he said: "Bring unto me a brother ye have of the same father as yourselves (but a different mother): see ye not that I pay out full measure and that I do provide the best hospitality,Kamina ujin shiri kaya yangicizhi ya'a zo na ugan: yega jin'ebe ya mi be yegi ye natso yi yan ndani be ye yin nae. Ngba yetso leye kendoe mie she tsunwan naa mi'ma'ajin mife jin bolo bolo ya egazhi sarauyin'a
Surah 12:60  ,       "Now if ye bring him not to me ye shall have no measure (of corn) from me nor shall ye (even) come near me.",To kagan ma ye be yami beu yin'a yea kara de tsunwan ndondo eba mibo bea ye mae ga dzodzo tsoba mi ma.
Surah 12:61 ,    They said: "We shall certainly seek to get our wish about him from his father: Indeed we shall do it.",Acigan: To yidea da din yangban babau cinle hakika ma yiga acinga jin.
Surah 12:62   ,          And (Joseph) told his servants to put their stock-in-trade (with which they had bartered) into their saddle-bags so they should know it only when they returned to their people in order that they might come back.,(Yusufu) cia gan be egi katauzhi gan: yea kaya na'ala sangwa yangici shi na la'adan jika'azhio ebo atsoa leu ye aga zheban da eba iyali'azhi na ebo ma a kezhea zhe ban'a zhin.
Surah 12:63          ,     Now when they returned to their father they said: "O our father! No more measure of grain shall we get (unless we take our brother): So send our brother with us that we may get our measure; and we will indeed take every care of him.",Lokaci na azhin eba baba'a na a gan: Ya wyoe babayi!

Surah 12:64       ,         He said: "Shall I trust you with him with any result other than when I trusted you with his brother aforetime But Allah is the best to take care (of him) and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!",Ugan: Ngba micin la aminci yaye etiubo Saide u yi iri aminci nami la yaye payin eti yegiu bo na. Soko tsayi Etsu na gan eba eyan tswao nao wyun ga mayi Etsu nagan eba yegun'o nao.
Surah 12:65    ,                    Then when they opened their baggage they found their stock-in-trade had been returned to them. They said: "O our father! What (more) can we desire this our stock-in-trade has been returned to us: so we shall get (more) food for our family; We shall take care of our brother; and add (at the same time) a full camel´s load (of grain to our provisions). This is but a small quantity.,Kamina abe kpe jika'azhi na a tsun yannazhi a la sangwa yangici shi na fi mini jika'azhio a yan'a la zheban ya'a. agan: Ya wyoe babayi!

Surah 12:66   ,                    (Jacob) said: "Never will I send him with you until ye swear a solemn oath to me in Allah´s name that ye will be sure to bring him back to me unless ye are yourselves hemmed in (and made powerless). And when they had sworn their solemn oath he said: "Over all that we say be Allah the witness and guardian!",(Baba'a) ci gan: "Mia tun'u lo ganni be ye yin'a sai ye ga jin mi alkawali tsakani ye be Sokoe kede hakika ye gau lazhin bea ya mi na saide uga'a ce kagbo ye" kamina abea alkawali jin beuyin na ugan: Soko ma wyun gayi Erio (wakili) eti egan nazhi yie gan nao.
Surah 12:67     ,                     Further he said: "O my sons! enter not all by one gate: enter ye by different gates. Not that I can profit you aught against Allah (with my advice): None can command except Allah: On Him do I put my trust: and let all that trust put their trust on Him.",Uci kezhea gan be: Ya ye egi mizhi!

Surah 12:68  ,                           And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined it did not profit them in the least against (the plan of) Allah: It was but a necessity of Jacob´s soul which he discharged. For he was by our instruction full of knowledge (and experience): but most men know not.,To lokaci na'a gandan dagan eko na baba'a gan ya'a na wuncin'otso kunke ya'a wo be yandoci ke yanna Soko kpa na lugwa' saide bukata ndoci uyio dan yangban Ya'akubuo nama wyun'udewo na hakikama ezauyio na yi be kpikpe yan yannazhi Yi la wu'u na amaade ekundondo zawangizhi kpea.
Surah 12:69       ,        Now when they came into Joseph´s presence he received his (full) brother to stay with him. He said (to him): "Behold! I am thy (own) brother; so grieve not at aught of their doings.",Kamina agandan eba Yusufuo na wyun'a yegiu dinba uci gan: Hakika mi yegi wyoe mi yio ebo acin'o ga nyin yangban be iri etun nazhie lo na ma.
Surah 12:70    ,          At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them he put the drinking cup into his brother´s saddle-bag. Then shouted out a crier: "O ye (in) the caravan! behold! ye are thieves without doubt!",Kamina wyun'a shiri yan kara'azhi jin ya'a zo na wyun'a evo tsunwan yan nuwanfin la'agun jika yegiubo gancin emi yaci ndoci ci yami gan: ya ye jamaa ezan daci nnazhi!

Surah 12:71 ,   They said turning towards them: "What is it that ye miss",A cia gan lokaci na azhe ye lo eba'a na: ki ya yan ye yio
Surah 12:72   ,        They said: "We miss the great beaker of the king; for him who produces it is (the reward of) a camel load; I will be bound by it.",Agan: Yie wa evo tsunwan nuwan fin yan etsu za (wun'a ya) zaeni ndondo na ma gau la be na wyun'ade eryatwa yan kara rakum nini; mitso gama'a gikini ya wuncin'o.
Surah 12:73   ,        (The brothers) said: "By Allah! well ye know that we came not to make mischief in the land and we are no thieves!",A ci gan: Wallahi hakika yetso kpewo kede yibe-be ebo yibey nyin yany'dan kinboa na yi majin igbecizhia.
Surah 12:74    , (The Egyptians) said: "What then shall be the penalty of this if ye are (proved) to have lied",(Zaba etsu zhi) cigan: ki'i yi foro naaga gun be za na aga deu beyin nao wun'ayi ganmana ye zun'o nao
Surah 12:75  ,        They said: "The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found should be held (as bondman) to atone for the (crime). Thus it is we punish the wrong-doers!",Agan: Foro wuncin wun'a ta eti zana aga deu jikaubo nao; foro'u (ala egwa'asun'u) acinga ga egagba yan azwalumizhi yio.
Surah 12:76   ,                             So he began (the search) with their baggage before (he came to) the baggage of his brother: at length he brought it out of his brother´s baggage. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that Allah willed it (so). We raise to degrees (of wisdom) whom We please: but over all endued with knowledge is one the All-Knowing.,Ucia ca be cin cinle jika'azhi kafi yan yegiuna gancin ucia evo tsunwan wuncin wa tinya dagan jika yegiubo.

Surah 12:77     ,                  They said: "If he steals there was a brother of his who did steal before (him)." But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart revealing not the secrets to them. He (simply) said (to himself): "Ye are the worse situated; and Allah knoweth best the truth of what ye assert!",Acigan: Wyun de ga yi yan yi ga to hakika yegi wyuntso yiyan le ani Yusufu cia egan nana swo dan yangban'ubo uma lau tinya wua ucie gan (dan yangban'ubo) yetso tsa yi za dedezhi na gan nao.

Surah 12:78       ,       They said: "O exalted one! Behold! he has a father aged and venerable (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place; for we see that thou art (gracious) in doing good.",Agan: Ya wyoe Aziz! Hakika uyibe babae na ma'aku ku na ebo acin'o a zaeni la mini yibo kinigibaubo; Hakika yi mae le wyo ye dan mini eza bolobolozhio.
Surah 12:79,            He said: "Allah forbid that we take other than him with whom we found our property: indeed (if we did so) we should be acting wrongfully.,Ugan: Soko'u gwo yiu tswa na yi ga gwasun zandoci na ma yi le kaya yi ye beu yin'a nae; yiga jin acin ngan yiga'afe dan mini azwalumizhio dan'ona.
Surah 12:80    ,                                Now when they saw no hope of his (yielding) they held a conference in private. The leader among them said: "Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah´s name and how before this ye did fail in your duty with Joseph Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me or Allah commands me; and He is the best to command.,Kamina abea kauna ba beuyin eti aye wa nao naaci da kapa-nni fe da baza Nunsa'a ci gan: Beke ye kpewo gan baba ye-yea alkawali la be ye yin yan tsakani ye be Soko yin'ana Yetso ma kpe iri eye na ye ya be be Yusufu'I na to mide a ya kin yan Misra'a har she babami ga mi ya izini yan zhinzhin koma Sokou jin hukunci naga bauna be mi yin.

Surah 12:83   ,              Jacob said: "Nay but ye have yourselves contrived a story (good enough) for you. So patience is most fitting (for me). Maybe Allah will bring them (back) all to me (in the end). For He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom.",Ugan: ujin acin'a yangban ye zhi dea yandoci la'a panin fi ye (eyan dede) hakuri de uga gye ya mi gan'o mi mae ba be Sokoe gan wyun'u kua zhi'u beu yami baenio. Hakika Soko gayi Etsu kpikpeo ugayi Etsu hikimao.
Surah 12:84   ,        And he turned away from them and said: "How great is my grief for Joseph!" And his eyes became white with sorrow and he fell into silent melancholy.,Ucia zunma uce eba'abo uci gan: kasa mire eti Yusufuo! Eyeuzhi cia zhe bokun ebo yangban yin'o gancin uma'a she be fushii.

Surah 12:87 ,                  "O my sons! go ye and enquire about Joseph and his brother and never give up hope of Allah´s Soothing Mercy: truly no one despairs of Allah´s Soothing Mercy except those who have no faith.",Ya ye egi mizhi!

Surah 12:88  ,                  Then when they came (back) into (Joseph´s) presence they said: "O exalted one! distress has seized us and our family: we have (now) brought but scanty capital: so pay us full measure (we pray thee) and treat it as charity to us: for Allah doth reward the charitable.",Lokaci na a gandan eba Yusufuo na agan: Ya wyoe Azizu egun yan madan wun'a de yi be iyali yizhi yima be-be be yanna yigaa sangwa yangici shi na nama gan daraja deana; ebo acin'o a tsunwan she yayi wyo mao jin sadakao yayi hakika Sokoe la egagba alheri ya zana gae jin sadakana.

Surah 12:90   ,                   They said: "Art thou indeed Joseph" He said "I am Joseph and this is my brother: Allah has indeed been gracious to us (all): behold he that is righteous and patient- never will Allah suffer the reward to be lost of those who do right.",Agan: "Kashi eti hakikao wyo ga yi Yusufuo" Ugan: Mi ga yi Yusufuo zanana ma yegi mi uyio; hakika Soko jin falala yayi hakika de zaeni ndondo naga sundan Soko na uma ci jin hakuri na to hakika Sokoe ta laada etun za guruzhi ya kpea.

Surah 12:96   ,                Then when the bearer of the good news came He cast (the shirt) over his face and he forthwith regained clear sight. He said: "Did I not say to you ´I know from Allah that which ye know not´",To lokaci na za na'a ya bushara yangban fa na be na wyun'a ewo ce keu fuskao ucia fe zanae leba ye na.

He said: "O my father! this is the fulfilment of my vision of old! Allah hath made it come true! He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you (all here) out of the desert (even) after Satan had sown enmity between me and my brothers.

Surah 12:102 ,            Such is one of the stories of what happened unseen which We reveal by inspiration unto thee; nor wast thou (present) with them then when they concerted their plans together in the process of weaving their plots.,Wuncinzhi dan mini labari gaibuzhio na Yie jin wahayiu ya wyo na.

Surah 12:106  ,    And most of them believe not in Allah without associating (other as partners) with Him!,Ekundondoa ma e jin imani be Sokoe baeni boa sai de aga eyan la'apau baci.
Surah 12:107    ,         Do they then feel secure from the coming against them of the covering veil of the wrath of Allah- or of the coming against them of the (final) Hour all of a sudden while they perceive not,Kashi gbani a aminci yaya gan azaba Soko nae rukpe na ubeu beu ya'a eti girikuo amaa laa fea dan kamina akpea na
Surah 12:108  ,              Say thou: "This is my way: I do invite unto Allah- on evidence clear as the seeing with one´s eyes- I and whoever follows me.

Surah 12:109,                            Nor did We send before thee (as messengers) any but men whom we did inspire- (men) living in human habitations. Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before them But the home of the hereafter is best for those who do right.

Surah 12:111     ,                 There is in their stories instruction for men endued with understanding.
