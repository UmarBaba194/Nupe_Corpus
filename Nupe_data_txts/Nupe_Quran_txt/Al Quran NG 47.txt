Surah 47:1   ,     Those who reject Allah and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah- their deeds will Allah render astray (from their mark).,Za nanzhi a jin kafirinci nan acie kan zazhi eko Soko yn da nan. Etun'azhi kpata a nyin ya.
Surah 47:2        ,         But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness and believe in the (Revelation) sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord- He will remove from them their ills and improve their condition.,Za nanzhiy ma a imani jin acie lo tun wangizhi nan a ma imani jin be yan nan acin be ya (Annabi) muhammadu nan kede u ga yi gaskiya nan fe be dagan nko yan tsocia bo na'o na Soko ga etun dede azhi fin ya yaa u ma ga alamariazhi tadzu
Surah 47:2        ,         But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness and believe in the (Revelation) sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord- He will remove from them their ills and improve their condition.,Za nanzhiy ma a imani jin acie lo tun wangizhi nan a ma imani jin be yan nan acin be ya (Annabi) muhammadu nan kede u ga yi gaskiya nan fe be dagan nko yan tsocia bo na'o na Soko ga etun dede azhi fin ya yaa u ma ga alamariazhi tadzu.
Surah 47:3    ,             This because those who reject Allah follow vanities while those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord: Thus does Allah set forth for men their lessons by similitudes.,Wuncin ma yi ebo nan kafirizhi a mi-tu eko yan egbin nan muminizhi ma a mi tu gaskiya nan fe be dagan nko yan Tsocia bo nan. Acin ga ga Sokoe la misalizhi wu zawangizhio.
Surah 47:4         ,                            Therefore when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight) smite at their necks; At length when ye have thoroughly subdued them bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been Allah´s Will He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of Allah- He will never let their deeds be lost.,Kamina nan ye ga gun be kafirizhiy (ekun dao nan) e wu'a koro'o har sai ye gade zankpe ta etia bo yecie la'aedan kangi be kagboe. Baci acin'o wun'a ba ye yea ya a fea lo koma a tso a la eti tacin'a'a sa har da lokaci nan nangban yan ekun ga cin-ta nan. Acinga ga'u yio wun'aba Soko ba aga zan kafirizhi kpe (uma'ajin be ekun yin'a) Ama'a de Soko jin'u jin aninga ebo u ma ye ye'u cin'u le be dozhi. Akika za nanzhi a ga'awu fi eko Soko nan etun'azhi a ta yakpea.
Surah 47:5,  Soon will He guide them and improve their condition,Bele yin Soko ga'ajin shiri u ma ga alamariazhi tadzu.
Surah 47:6,   And admit them to the Garden which He has announced for them.,Uma gaa la'a gandan Aljannanao nan ufe ya'a labari u nan.
Surah 47:7    ,    O ye who believe! If ye will aid (the cause of) Allah He will aid you and plant your feet firmly.,Ya ye nazhi'a imani jin nan ye ga jin Soko taimako wun'tso'a jin'e taimako ga uma ga kinigi yezhigboka.
Surah 47:8,     But those who reject (Allah)- for them is destruction and (Allah) will render their deeds astray (from their mark).,Zanazhiy ma'ajin kafirinci nan hallaka ga'ajin tabbata ya'a etun'azhi ma ga' nyin ya.
Surah 47:9    ,   That is because they hate the Revelation of Allah; so He has made their deeds fruitless.,Wunci ma yi ebo na a navo nan a la'mi tu na Soko cin'be yn nan Soko cia etun'azhi nyin ya.
Surah 47:10   ,            Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them (who did evil) Allah brought utter destruction on them and similar (fates await) those who reject Allah.,Kashiy a za az kpe eti kinboa acia le kendoe zoba yan za nazhiy shiadzo na' yi yi na'a Ngan Soko 'ajin hallaka to iri wuncin ma ga'ajin tabbata ya kafirizhi.
Surah 47:11  ,        That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe but those who reject Allah have no protector.,Wuncin ma yi  ebo nan Soko ga yi Ndakata yan minizhio nao akika ma kafirizhi de ndakata'a.
Surah 47:12   ,                  Verily Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; while those who reject Allah will enjoy (this world) and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode.,Akika Soko ga za nanzhiy ga jin imani a cie lo tun wngi zhi nan la gan dan Aljannao nan nuwan zhie je fi tako shin'u zhio nan. Kafirizhi ma e wo ma izhe za amae gi yan'za kendoe dabbazhie gi yanzhi za na akika enan ga yi ezhe kebao.
Surah 47:13   ,          And how many cities with more power than thy city which has driven thee out have We destroyed (for their sins) and there was none to aid them.,Alkaryazhi danbo dokun nanzhiy gboka gan za alkarya wyozhi nan zhiy nyan'wyo tin ya nan kpata yi ajin hallaka a made zandondo jin'a taimakoa.
Surah 47:14      ,      Is then one who is on a clear (Path) from his Lord no better than one to whom the evil of his conduct seems pleasing and such as follow their own lustsNgba za nae le izhe eti hujja nan fe be nko yan tsoci ubo nan ga'zhe yeni beza nan etun dedeuzhi a sa fiu acie le izhe eti etun yangban'o nan
Surah 47:15        ,                                   (Here is) a Parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised: in it are rivers of water incorruptible; rivers of milk of which the taste never changes; rivers of wine a joy to those who drink; and rivers of honey pure and clear. In it there are for them all kinds of fruits; and Grace from their Lord. (Can those in such Bliss) be compared to such as shall dwell for ever in the Fire and be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels (to pieces),Kwatankoci yan kendoe Aljanna nan Soko ajin muminizhi alkawali na uyi nan minin bo eduzhi danbo yan nuwan nan jin vunvuci'a nan. To eduzhi danbo yan nuwan (nono) nan eman'u wun'e zhegba'a nan to eduzhidanbo yan efu nan yi lilici nan ama ke yibe yangici sun sun iri ndondoe fi bo ganni. be gaafarae dagan eba tsociabo Ngba aga za na zhi fi mini ni'ma nanao tutun na laasan tatu be za nan gun mini enao tutun yin nan Ganci acie ya nuwan yipa fin nae dza edin'azhi ya nan.
Surah 47:16       ,                And among them are men who listen to thee but in the end when they go out from thee they say to those who have received Knowledge "What is it he said just then" Such are men whose hearts Allah has sealed and who follow their own lusts.,Ama de dan miniabo nanzhiy ajin ashi tukpa ya wy nan kami nan a ga tin ya dagan eba wyo bo nan a fe gan be gan be za nan zhiy yi be ilimiy nan gan: Ngba ki'ufe gan mangio Za wuncinzhi ga Soko te yangban'ao acia-mitu etun yangban'azhi.
Surah 47:17 ,    But to those who receive Guidance He increases the (light of) Guidance and bestows on them their Piety and Restraint (from evil).,Za nazhiy ma ga'ajin shiri nan; Soko ' abea shiri U maa Twarya be dansun' uyio dan yang Ban'abo.
Surah 47:18          ,    Do they then only wait for the Hour- that it should come on them of a sudden But already have come some tokens thereof and when it (actually) is on them how can they benefit then by their admonition,Kashiy e' tu yetu gan alkiyami ubeu dzun u fia Akika alamauzhi da bea ni. Ke a be jin jin nao kami nan Yan nae la jin gangbanan ga bea tula ya'a nao
Surah 47:19         ,    Know therefore that there is no god but Allah and ask forgiveness for thy fault and for the men and women who believe: for Allah knows how ye move about and how ye dwell in your homes.,wyo yo kpeo wo ke de akika adeyandondo nan gwo yin a jin bauta ya naa sai de Soko na wyo mao wa gafarao ya zunubi wyizhi to Mumini ba. Gizhi to mumini ynzagizhi akika Soko de kpikpi yan ba nan zhi ye iwo nan U ma de kpikpi yan ezhe kebaezhi.
Surah 47:20     ,                     Those who believe say "Why is not a sura sent down (for us)" But when a sura of basic or categorical meaning is revealed and fighting is mentioned therein thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with a look of one in swoon at the approach of death. But more fitting for them-,Za nanzhi'a imani jin nan e gan gan: kiY la aci cin sura (Woro) bea yin'o Kami nan a ga be cin Sura yan hukunci ndoci be yaa aci tun ekun ye danminiiubo nan Wyo'a le Munafikizhi ye a fe cin wyo le ke za nan nangban yan ajali a rukpeu nan robonkpe wun'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 47:21     ,      Were it to obey and say what is just and when a matter is resolved on it were best for them if they were true to Allah.,Emi latu foro be egan wangi gan'e (u ga gye gan'o). Kaminan ala'mari gaa gbo ucia tula (Ke ekun gun ga gan'o) nan a ga Soko ya gaskiya ya (a cia tin ya) da wuncin'ade alheri ya'gan.
Surah 47:22      ,   Then is it to be expected of you if ye were put in authority that ye will do mischief in the land and break your ties of kith and kin,Akika kyengi u yio yega bea zunma zheta (yeci da gun kun'a) ye'a bea fe za nanzhie nyin yan kpe eti kinbo nan ye ci ga'afe za nan zhie sa dangi bo ya na.
Surah 47:23 ,     Such are the men whom Allah has cursed for He has made them deaf and blinded their sight.,Za wuncinzhi ga Soko bu kuti kpeo u cia te tukpa Ucia eyeazhi nan (e le gaskiya ye bea sai ganmanan).
Surah 47:24  ,    Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Qur´an or are their hearts locked up by them,Kashiy e kpa ye kpa nan shidunan eti Alkuranu boa Kashiy a giyekozhi la'atsu'a yangbanzhi tsu
Surah 47:25    ,           Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them- the Evil One has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes.,Akika za nazhi a zunma laa ya a adini nan(acia jin ridda) baci nan bayani yan bawu a tula ya'ani nan akika Sheitan ga pa (kafirinci) nin fi ao wunga ma gan gan fia eti bo.
Surah 47:25   ,            Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them- the Evil One has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes.,Akika za nazhi a zunma laa ya a adini nan(acia jin ridda) baci nan bayani yan bawu a tula ya'ani nan akika Sheitan ga pa (kafirinci) nin fi ao wunga ma gan gan fia eti bo.
Surah 47:26     ,         This because they said to those who hate what Allah has revealed "We will obey you in part of (this) matter"; but Allah knows their (inner) secrets.,Wuncin mayi ebo nan a gan be za nazhie na hukunci nan Soko cinzhiyn vo nan gan: Yi ga mi tu ye dan mini alamari ndocizhio. Akika Soko de kpikpe yannazhiy e swo nan.
Surah 47:26  ,            This because they said to those who hate what Allah has revealed "We will obey you in part of (this) matter"; but Allah knows their (inner) secrets.,Wuncin mayi ebo nan a gan be za nazhie na hukunci nan Soko cinzhiyn vo nan gan: Yi ga mi tu ye dan mini alamari ndocizhio. Akika Soko de kpikpe yannazhiy e swo nan.
Surah 47:27 ,     But how (will it be) when the angels take their souls at death and smite their faces and their backs,Gancin Ke'a da da nao kami nan Malaikazhi gae gwo rayi be'a yin acie wu'a fuskazhio to zunmazhio nao
Surah 47:28 ,        This because they followed that which called forth the Wrath of Allah and they hated Allah´s good pleasure; so He made their deeds of no effect.,Wuncin ma yi ebo nan a emi laatu yan nan Soko wa'a nan acia nanvo la'a dan yedajin'u bo nan U cia etun'zhi gbin ya.
Surah 47:29    ,      Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think that Allah will not bring to light all their rancour,Kashiy za nan zhiy yi be batan yan yangban'e'na'e kpa ye kpa gan eyan dede nazhiy a swo fi yangban'o nan Soko a kua tin ya woa
Surah 47:30     ,      Had We so wiled We could have shown them up to thee and thou shouldst have known them by their marks: but surely thou wilt know them by the tone of their speech! And Allah knows all that ye do.U ga ba Yi ba da yi ga 'la wu wye akika ma wyo gaa kpeye be alamaazhiy wyo ma'a kezhe kpea ye eba egan kogiazhio. Akika Soko de kpikpe yan etun nazhi ye lo nan.
Surah 47:31    ,   And We shall try you until We test those among you who strive their utmost and persevere in patience; and We shall try your reported (mettle).Wallahi Yi gae mancin le har sai za nazhi gae jin jihadi ebo Soko nan ga tula minie bo to za nazhie jin ankuri nan yi ma ga labariezhi mancin le.
Surah 47:32      ,              Those who reject Allah hinder (men) from the Path of Allah and resist the Messenger after Guidance has been clearly shown to them will not injure Allah in the least but He will make their deeds of no effect.,Akika za nazhie jin kafirci acie kan zawangizhi eko Soko yn da nan ama kezhea le tuci ba baci nan bayani yan bawu a tula ya aa ni na a la egun ndondotso Soko woa Soko ma ga'a etunzhi nyi ya.
Surah 47:33   ,      O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey the messenger and make not vain your deeds!,Ya ye nazhia imani jin nan! Yea mi tu Soko ye mae la mie tu tuci ye mae ga nyin etun'ezhi ya ma.
Surah 47:34    ,          Those who reject Allah and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah then die rejecting Allah- Allah will not forgive them.,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci acie kan zawangizhi eko yan Soko yn da nan gancin acia tsu eti kafirincio nan Soko fa bea yin'a.
Surah 47:35     ,      Be not weary and faint-hearted crying for peace when ye should be uppermost: for Allah is with you and will never put you in loss for your (good) deeds.,Ega to gbogun ma Ye mae ga tan'a gwa fe wa gyra bea yin ma. Akika yega ta eti abo Soko ma dan be ye yin U maa ta etun yezhi ya kpea.
Surah 47:36          ,  The life of this world is but play and amusement: and if ye believe and guard against Evil He will grant you your recompense and will not ask you (to give up) your possessions.,Akika rayuwa izhe edzo u yio be Shagalae Ye ma ga imani jin ye cie sundan Soko U ma'a gbin yegan yan dukiya yezhia.
Surah 47:37 ,    If He were to ask you for all of them and press you ye would covetously withhold and He would bring out all your ill-feeling.,Uga gbin ye gan yan dukiya yezhi ye gau le ye eba yiba nan yemaafe tan yanbo U ma ga eyan dede nazhiy ye pa fi yangban'o nan ku ke fi-li.
Surah 47:38  ,                          Behold ye are those invited to spend (of your substance) in the Way of Allah: But among you are some that are niggardly. But any who are niggardly are so at the expense of their own souls. But Allah is free of all wants and it is ye that are needy. If ye turn back (from the Path) He will substitute in your stead another people; then they would not be like you!,Ye dan nan ye ga e yi gan ye be wu dukiyayezhie fi eko Soko bo mini ebo ade nazhie tan'yanbo na akika zaeni ndondo na ga tan yanbo nan eti tacin'u gau tan be yin'o Soko Etsu kunkunke u yio yetso tsa yi talakazhio. Ye ma ga zunma zheta U gae sangwa be zandocizhiy amaafe (yanbotanci) dozhin'e zhia.
