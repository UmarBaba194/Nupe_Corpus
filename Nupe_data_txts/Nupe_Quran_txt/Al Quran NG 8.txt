Surah 8:1   ,               They ask thee concerning (things taken as) spoils of war. Say: "(such) spoils are at the disposal of Allah and the Messenger: So fear Allah and keep straight the relations between yourselves: Obey Allah and His Messenger if ye do believe.",E'gbin wyogan eti hukunci yan Gani'imao Gangan:- Gani'ima (naagade kunda yanmusuluncio na) yan Soko uyio Toci ebo acin'o esundan Soko ye mae fe jin gyara tsakani ebo be dozhi yemae fe gba Soko to Tuciu wun'ayi muminizhiye yiona.
Surah 8:2      ,          For Believers are those who when Allah is mentioned feel a tremor in their hearts and when they hear His signs rehearsed find their faith strengthened and put (all) their trust in their Lord;,Hakika de zanazhie ye muminizhia agayi zanazhi kandondo na aga sunna Soko tunye yangban'azhie la'she be dansun (Sokoe) nao ama ga aya Soko zhigba ya'a wun'ajin ubea imani jin (be Sokoe) Tsociama wyun gae yakpe dan hali ndondo bo.
Surah 8:2 ,               For Believers are those who when Allah is mentioned feel a tremor in their hearts and when they hear His signs rehearsed find their faith strengthened and put (all) their trust in their Lord;,Hakika de zanazhie ye muminizhia agayi zanazhi kandondo na aga sunna Soko tunye yangban'azhie la'she be dansun (Sokoe) nao ama ga aya Soko zhigba ya'a wun'ajin ubea imani jin (be Sokoe) Tsociama wyun gae yakpe dan hali ndondo bo.
Surah 8:3 ,    Who establish regular prayers and spend (freely) out of the gifts We have given them for sustenance:,Zanazhie ku sallah gikini na ama'ajin afe wu dukiya'azhi mini arziki nazhi Yi la ya'a na (fi eko Soko'o).
Surah 8:4   ,       Such in truth are the believers: they have grades of dignity with their Lord and forgiveness and generous sustenance:,Za wuncinzhi agayi muminizhi yan gaskiyao. Ayi be daraja kozhi dan eba Tsociabo to gafara (na Wyun'ajin'ana) to arziki na wancin na.
Surah 8:4    ,      Such in truth are the believers: they have grades of dignity with their Lord and forgiveness and generous sustenance:,Za wuncinzhi agayi muminizhi yan gaskiyao. Ayi be daraja kozhi dan eba Tsociabo to gafara (na Wyun'ajin'ana) to arziki na wancin na.
Surah 8:5    ,      Just as thy Lord ordered thee out of thy house in truth even though a party among the Believers disliked it,Kendoe Tsoci wyoe la wyo tinya dagan emi wyobo be gaskiyae na hakika Sashi Mini muminizhio ajin afe navo.(na'atinya nbo ebo Soko'o na.
Surah 8:6    ,      Disputing with thee concerning the truth after it was made manifest as if they were being driven to death and they (actually) saw it.,Acia jin afe gbomi bewyoyin dan mini alamari gaskiya'a latu'ani na (acie jin bojin) ke wyoa gangan e'da'agwa da lo eba ajali na ala'alima amae'leu ye.
Surah 8:7 ,                     Behold! Allah promised you one of the two (enemy) parties that it should be yours: Ye wished that the one unarmed should be yours but Allah willed to justify the Truth according to His words and to cut off the roots of the Unbelievers;-,To kamina Soko jin ye alkawali yan nasara ta etijama'a ninio mini jama'a gubabao nao kede Wyunga ye la'ata'atio na ye cie kpaye gan jam'a nazhi de eyan kun'ana aga Sokoa la yaye yeo na Soko ma'akpa shizo gan wyunga gaskiyala'ajin tabbata be hukunci uyin Umau la edzo yan kafirizhiu dzau ya.
Surah 8:8,      That He might justify Truth and prove Falsehood false distasteful though it be to those in guilt.,Ebo ula gaskiya'u la'ujin tabbata Umaula ganmana'u nyin'u ya kadalefi jincizhi ga navo na.
Surah 8:9  ,        Remember ye implored the assistance of your Lord and He answered you: "I will assist you with a thousand of the angels ranks on ranks.",(Ye'pa) Kamina ye fe ba taimako dagan eba Tsoci yebo na Umacia aduwa ye gwo kede :- hakika mia jin ye taimako be malaika kpu'utsun'y nazhia lami latu dozhi na.
Surah 8:10      ,           Allah made it but a message of hope and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from Allah: and Allah is Exalted in Power Wise.,Soko ma la wuncin la fea saide yangbanfa alheri ebo ma to yangban yezhi ala'ashi tsu'uyin beu yin ye mae kpe'ewo kede nasara udan be zando yin'a sai be Sokoe na : Hakika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio.Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 8:11  ,                   Remember He covered you with a sort of drowsiness to give you calm as from Himself and he caused rain to descend on you from heaven to clean you therewith to remove from you the stain of Satan to strengthen your hearts and to plant your feet firmly therewith.,(Epa) Kamina Soko la yi-gbe ta cia la'akpe ye na Ucia fe aminci yaye dagan eba ubo Uci fe du ele be yaye dagan sanmao ebo ula ye yeu li beu yin Uma'ula shikan yan shetan yan'u kpe'u ya be yin ebo ma ula yan gban yezhiu wan'u pa be kagbo imani uma'u la bici kinpa yezhiu g okau ta eti kinbo.
Surah 8:12    ,                  Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instil terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them.",Kamina Tsoci wyoe fe jin wahayi fi Malaikazhi na kede ;Hakika mi dan be ye yin ebo acin'o egbo yangban yan muminizhi ka be imani bele yin yin Miga edo be dansun'i ce dan yangban yan za nazhia jin kafirinci nao ebo aci'n'o ewua eti koroazhio ye mae wua vundunugiazhio.
Surah 8:13 ,           This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger: If any contend against Allah and His Messenger Allah is strict in punishment.,Wuncin mayi ebo na a le Soko be Tuciu yin ba nao. Zan dondo na ma gae le Soko be Tuciu yin ba na to hakika Soko gbota eba azaba jin'o.
Surah 8:14,     Thus (will it be said): "Taste ye then of the (punishment): for those who resist Allah is the penalty of the Fire.",Wuncin zhi ga dan'o nao efe fin azaba Soko hakika ma azaba yan ena uga'ajin tabbata ya kafirizhi.
Surah 8:15 ,         O ye who believe! when ye meet the Unbelievers in hostile array never turn your backs to them.,Ya yenazhia imani jin na! kandondo na ye ga'gun be kafirizhi ekundao na to ega kara zhe zunmayezhi ya'a ma.
Surah 8:16  ,                 If any do turn his back to them on such a day - unless it be in a stratagem of war or to retreat to a troop (of his own)- he draws on himself the wrath of Allah and his abode is Hell- an evil refuge (indeed)!,Zandondo na ga zunmauzhe cie bici efo iri wuncin'ina sai de wyo gae wa gan wyoa ye enasa ya ekungun na koma wyoa zheban da tsun ekun gunci nayncin wyozhi na (ka gan ujin be uzuri yin'a) to zawuncin'a zheban zhe be ewunzhe dagan eba Soko ezhekebau mayi ena jahanna ma bibi ma'jin tabbata ya zoba wuncin.
Surah 8:17  ,                  It is not ye who slew them; it was Allah: when thou threwest (a handful of dust) it was not thy act but Allah´s: in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself: for Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).,Uma jin ye wu a amma'de Soko wu'ao:umaji wyo ce yan ke'a kamina wyo ce yan na'a. Amma'de Soko ce yan'o :Ebo ma Wyun'uma Muminizhiu cin'ule be mima cin le wangi'I dagan eba ubo.Hakika Soko Etsu nae wo na uyioEtsu kpikpe uyio.Surah 8:18     That and also because Allah is He Who makes feeble the plans and stratagem of the Unbelievers.Wuncinzhi ga dan'o nao hakika ma Soko ga tanadi yan kafirizhi to gbogun.
Surah 8:19  ,                     (O Unbelievers!) if ye prayed for victory and judgment now hath the judgment come to you: if ye desist (from wrong) it will be best for you: if ye return (to the attack) so shall We. Not the least good will your forces be to you even if they were multiplied: for verily Allah is with those who believe!,Wun'ayi gan nassara ye'e wao to nassara dabe yaye yeani ye ma ga etun dede lugwa to wuncin gayi alheri ya yeo ye ma ga ke dazhin (eti ewun sun'o)yi tso ma'ake dazhin (be azabze) jama'a nazhi ma ye aga dokun gan'acin. Hakika ma Soko dan be Muminizhi.
Surah 8:20  ,        O ye who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger and turn not away from him when ye hear (him speak).Ya ye nazhia imani jin na ye'a gba Soko to Tuci'u ye mae ga zhe zunma ta alamari Soko ma alaali ma ye tsoe wo (na wyun'e yie na).
Surah 8:21 ,      Nor be like those who say "We hear" but listen not:,Ye mae ga'a fe iri yan zanazhi gangan:"yi wo" ala'alima e'woa na ma.
Surah 8:22 ,        For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf and the dumb- those who understand not.,Hakika dabba na biyegan mini dabbazhi eba Soko'o na agayi zanazhia te tukpa (e'wogan Soko'a) acie zhe edingizhi ama'afe zanazhie lo'tun be hankalia yin'a na.
Surah 8:23  ,        If Allah had found in them any good. He would indeed have made them listen: (As it is) if He had made them listen they would but have turned back and declined (Faith).,Soko ga tsun alheri tsun fi bea yin da wyun'a ya'a iko yan wiwo (ama jin eza alheri zhia) ka'Uga yaa iiko wiwo hakika aga zunmazheta (gaskiya) aci ga keu lugwa.
Surah 8:24    ,               O ye who believe! give your response to Allah and His Messenger when He calleth you to that which will give you life; and know that Allah cometh in between a man and his heart and that it is He to Whom ye shall (all) be gathered.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Efe ye yiyi Soko be yan Tuciy kandondo na uga yie lo eba yan na'a be rayi be rayuwa wangi na:Ye mae kpe wo kede Soko wyun'ajin'ulo dan tsakani zawangi be yan nazhigae sa fi yangban'una (be ajali'i) hakika ma Etsu uyio na ga ye kpata kuyekan zhiyegboro'ubo na.
Surah 8:25,            And fear tumult or oppression which affecteth not in particular (only) those of you who do wrong: and know that Allah is strict in punishment.,Ye mae tswa fitina na masiibau wun'a kan eti azwalumi nazhi din'u be kawan yin'a na ye mae kpee wo kede hakika Soko Etsu na gbota eba jinjin azaba bona uyio.
Surah 8:26    ,              Call to mind when ye were a small (band) despised through the land and afraid that men might despoil and kidnap you; But He provided a safe asylum for you strengthened you with His aid and gave you Good things for sustenance: that ye might be grateful.,Ye mae pa lokacina yea fe ezadegi nama'afe eza gbogunnzhi fi kinbo na ye ci fe sundan na zandoncizhia bea ye fe la na Soko cia ye ya ecinba (yan yangbanshi madinao) Ucia ye ya kagbo be nasara uyin uci kezhea ye ya arziki dagan mini yangici wangizhio ebo ujinwo be wuncinzhi ye ga'afe za nazhie jin yebo ya Soko na.
Surah 8:27 ,         O ye that believe! betray not the trust of Allah and the Messenger nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to you.,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! E ga fe ta Soko to Tuciu be jinjin hainci'ima ye tso mae ga jin dozhi hainci'fe gi amana dozhi ma  ala'ali ma yetso kpewo ke ugyea na.
Surah 8:28   ,      And know ye that your possessions and your progeny are but a trial; and that it is Allah with Whom lies your highest reward.,Ye mae kpe kede hakika dukiya yezhi to egi yezhi fitina ayio na hakika ma (zana ga tswa Soko danbo na) egagba na wancin na ga'ajin tabatta yau dan eba Soko.
Surah 8:29  ,               O ye who believe! if ye fear Allah He will grant you a criterion (to judge between right and wrong) remove from you (all) evil (that may afflict) you and forgive you: for Allah is the Lord of grace unbounded.Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! ,Ye ga'afe za nazhie tswa Soko cie sundan una uga etsazhi be erikpe wangizhi la'aya ye uma ga etun dede yezhi kpata paya ya ye uma'afe be yin Soko ma Etsu falala uyio na wancin na.
Surah 8:30   ,            Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee to keep thee in bonds or slay thee or get thee out (of thy home). They plot and plan and Allah too plans; but the best of planners is Allah.,Wyo mao pa lokaci na zanazhia jin kafirinci na fe pa makirinci eti wyobo na ebo ala wyo'a kan'adan koma ala wyo ya'a wu koma ala wyo ya'a nyan adzun ezhio na. Acie dinyin fe jin makirinci. Soko otso mae woa gbata be makirincia yin Soko ma ta eti zanazhie jin makirinci kpata na.
Surah 8:30 ,              Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee to keep thee in bonds or slay thee or get thee out (of thy home). They plot and plan and Allah too plans; but the best of planners is Allah.,Wyo mao pa lokaci na zanazhia jin kafirinci na fe pa makirinci eti wyobo na ebo ala wyo'a kan'adan koma ala wyo ya'a wu koma ala wyo ya'a nyan adzun ezhio na.

Surah 8:31,                When Our Signs are rehearsed to them they say: "We have heard this (before): if we wished we could say (words) like these: these are nothing but tales of the ancients."Ama ga gba aya Yizhi yaa ajin agangan: ",Hakika yiwo nana (leani) uga bayi tso da yitso agan iri nana ma nana de  ufea saide ecin yan zamafarizhi.
Surah 8:32   ,               Remember how they said: "O Allah if this is indeed the Truth from Thee rain down on us a shower of stones form the sky or send us a grievous penalty.",To kamina agan gan: ya wyoe Soko! Wun'ayi gan alamari nana wyun gayi gaskiya na fe be dagan eba wyobo nao to dule yan takun azaba be kpeyi dagan sanmao koma wyo'obe'o yayi be azaba ndoci na tan na.
Surah 8:33         ,  But Allah was not going to send them a penalty whilst thou wast amongst them; nor was He going to send it whilst they could ask for pardon.,Soko mafe Etsu na ajin'a azaba na'a al'alima wyo yidan ta'acin'abo na'a Soko mafe Etsu na'ajin'a azaba na'a ala'lima afe zanazhie ba gafara na'a.
Surah 8:34 ,                   But what plea have they that Allah should not punish them when they keep out (men) from the sacred Mosque - and they are not its guardians No men can be its guardians except the righteous; but most of them do not understand.,Ki'ma dan bea yin'o na'ala Soko cia jin'azaba na'a yin'o ala'alima ekan zawangizhi ke masalaci Harami lugwa nao Uma jin atsawun hak yan tswi tswa wun'a. Hakika zanazhi wun hakika yan tswi tswa'una aga yi zanazhi gae tswa Soko acie sundan'Unao. Amma'de ekun dondo azhi ade kpikpea.
Surah 8:35,            Their prayer at the House (of Allah) is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands: (Its only answer can be) "Taste ye the penalty because ye blasphemed.",Salla'azhi ma eba kata (ka'abao) ufea sai de iko-be be egwa-koe: eboacin'o efe fin azaba ebo iri etun kafirinci nazhi ye fe lo na.
Surah 8:36   ,                 The Unbelievers spend their wealth to hinder (man) from the path of Allah and so will they continue to spend; but in the end they will have (only) regrets and sighs; at length they will be overcome: and the Unbelievers will be gathered together to Hell;-,Hakika zanazhia jin kafirinci be Sokoe na ajin afe wu dukiya azhi ebo adeba'akan zawangi zhi ezan ta eti ekpa Soko: to aga dukiya'zhi wugagancin uci ga'afe ro-- n kpe yaa gancin be aciga'a zankpe zanazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na a kuaku yekan lo ena jahanama.
Surah 8:37  ,               In order that Allah may separate the impure from the pure put the impure one on another heap them together and cast them into Hell. They will be the ones to have lost.,Ebo Soko debau la eyan dedezhiu tsa'u ya dagan mini eyan wangi zhio Uciu la eyan dedezhiu ku'ukpe eti sashio uci ga'u la'afe dan mini ena jahanamao. Zawun ci zhi aga yi eza hassarazhio
Surah 8:38      ,         Say to the Unbelievers if (now) they desist (from Unbelief) their past would be forgiven them; but if they persist the punishment of those before them is already (a matter of warning for them).,Gan ya zanazhia jin kafirinci na aga gwa kpe eti yan na Sokoa kan na aafa beayin yan yannazhi ajin shidzo na hakika ekpa hallaka yan za mafari zhi wun'a shidzoa ni.
Surah 8:39    ,           And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere; but if they cease verily Allah doth see all that they do.,Ye mae gun'akun har fitina ndondo uga ke ma gancin adini jin baenio ulauzhe ebo Soko ya Soko gbu'ugi. To aga bea egwa kpebo to hakika Sokoe cin'ale be iri etun nazhi e'lo na.
Surah 8:40 ,        If they refuse be sure that Allah is your Protector - the best to protect and the best to help.,Ama ga zunma zheta to ye kpe wo dan'ona kede hakika Soko gayi Ndakata ye yeona: Madanla be Etsu na yi Ndakatana Madanla be Etsu taimakoe.
Surah 8:41,                                And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire (in war) a fifth share is assigned to Allah- and to the Messenger and to near relatives orphans the needy and the wayfarer- if ye do believe in Allah and in the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing- the Day of the meeting of the two forces. For Allah hath power over all things.,Ye mae kpe wo kede yan dondo na ye gade yan ganima na to Soko ga wun nini yan gutsun wun'o to yan Tuci to eza tsonbazhi to ekungizhi to eza gwa gbagizhi ye ga'afe gan yea imani jin be Sokoe be yanna yi cin be ya wuzhi Yi (MUHAMMADU)efo ekun-erikpe na efo na jama'a guba da gun dozhi na. Soko ma Etsu iko uyio ta eti yandondo.
Surah 8:42,                                  Remember ye were on the hither side of the valley and they on the farther side and the caravan on lower ground than ye. Even if ye had made a mutual appointment to meet ye would certainly have failed in the appointment: But (thus ye met) that Allah might accomplish a matter already enacted; that those who died might die after a clear Sign (had been given) and those who lived might live after a Clear Sign (had been given). And verily Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).,Ye mae pa kamina yedan kansanta natso tsoba na ama dan kansata natsoa kpe ya na gancin kodagba'azhi ma (afe kpankpanyin be eba ye) aci dan tako yebo.

Surah 8:43,                   Remember in thy dream Allah showed them to thee as few: if He had shown them to thee as many ye would surely have been discouraged and ye would surely have disputed in (your) decision; but Allah saved (you): for He knoweth well the (secrets) of (all) hearts.,Wyo mao pa kamina Soko fe la'a wu wye dan mini eleo ke jama'a degi ayio na daaci gan ula'a lawu wye kendoe adokun na da' ye ga'a wo dansun ye ga'a to gbogun ye ma'afe gbomi be dozhi eti alamari wuncin'o amma'ade Sokoa egwa kan: Hakika wyin (Soko) Uyi be kpikpe yan yannazhi fi yangban zawangizhio na.
Surah 8:44  ,                And remember when ye met He showed them to you as few in your eyes and He made you appear as contemptible in their eyes: that Allah might accomplish a matter already enacted. For to Allah do all questions go back (for decision).,Epa kamina ufe la'a wu ye na kamina ye bea gun be dozhi na eye yebo afe eza de gi umaa yetso la'fe eza de'gi dan eyeabo ebo Soko'ula hukunci'uba eti alamari ndoci na ga fe na: Alamari kpata ma eba Soko ga a kezhe lo'o.
Surah 8:45  ,         O ye who believe! When ye meet a force be firm and call Allah in remembrance much (and often); that ye may prosper:,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! ye ga bea gun gun be jama' ndocizhi eti ekun'o to yea kpe gikini. Ye mae fe tun Sokoe ye sarauyin ujin wo be wuncin yega tso guri.
Surah 8:46   ,         And obey Allah and His Messenger; and fall into no disputes lest ye lose heart and your power depart; and be patient and persevering: For Allah is with those who patiently persevere:,Ye mae la mie tu Soko be Tuci'u yin ye mae ga gbomi (yan cen leba) be dozhi ma kacin'a ye ga to gbogun gancin kagboe ma ga'a gan be yin ye mae la hakurie jin. Hakika Soko ajin udan be zanazhi gae jin hakuri nae.
Surah 8:47,                And be not like those who started from their homes insolently and to be seen of men and to hinder (men) from the path of Allah: For Allah compasseth round about all that they do.,Ye mae ga'afe ke dozhin zanazhi tinya eti fahri jin'o be ebo zawangizhia leaye na ma acie kan zawangizhi ezanda ta eti ekpa Soko: Soko maa etun nazhie lo kpatana makezhe.
Surah 8:48  ,                                 Remember Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them and said: "No one among men can overcome you this day while I am near to you": But when the two forces came in sight of each other he turned on his heels and said: "Lo! I am clear of you; lo! I see what ye see not; Lo! I fear Allah: for Allah is strict in punishment.",To kamina shaitan yin'a etun dedeazhi la'a pa nin fia na Uci gan: zandondo danbo mini zawangizhio na'a zan yekpe na mi ma dan be ye yin kpan-yin "Gancin kamina jama'a guba 'ba bea gunbe dozhi na shaitan cida'uda zunma Uci gan: "Hakika mia egwa mi wa be ye yin! mi mae le yannazhi ye le yea na ye mi mae sundan Soko: Soko ma Etsu uyio na gbota azaba jin'ona.
Surah 8:49 ,                Lo! the hypocrites say and those in whose hearts is a disease: "These people- their religion has misled them." But if any trust in Allah behold! Allah is Exalted in might Wise.,To lokaci na munafukzhi to zanazhi batan dan yangban'abo na fe gangan gan: " Adini yan za nanazhi wun'a ta fi egbin'o" zaeni ndondo na ga'a yakpe Soko na to hakika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 8:50    ,        If thou couldst see when the angels take the souls of the Unbelievers (at death) (How) they smite their faces and their backs (saying): "Taste the penalty of the blazing Fire-,Be ma da aci gan wyo le ye lokaci na malaikazhi gae gwo rayi yan za nazhi ajin kafirinci na malaikazhie ciafe wua fuska'azhio to zunma'azhioacia fe gan'agan: "E fe fin azaba yan ena kikeci

Surah 8:52   ,             "(Deeds) after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and of those before them: They rejected the Signs of Allah and Allah punished them for their crimes: for Allah is Strong and Strict in punishment:,Kendoe alada yan jama'a yan fir'auna be zanazhi shiadzo na ajin kafirinci be aya Soko zhi Soko cia wan be lefiazhi hakika Soko Etsu kagbo uyio Etsu na ma gbota eba azaba jin'o na uyio.
Surah 8:53   ,              "Because Allah will never change the grace which He hath bestowed on a people until they change what is in their (own) souls: and verily Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).",Wuncin ma afe ebona hakika Soko ufe Etsu naela egbazhe de de dan mini ni'ima na uga la ya jama'a ndoci eti Eman'o na'a sai de atso ga egbazhe de de la'adan yangban'azhio.

Surah 8:54  ,              (Deeds) after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and those before them": They treated as false the Signs of their Lord: so We destroyed them for their crimes and We drowned the people of Pharaoh: for they were all oppressors and wrong-doers.,Kenadoe alada yan jama'a yan firaunazhi yi na to zanazhi shia dzo na to Yi cia jin hallaka be zunubia zhi yi cia jama'a yan fir'auna zhi gbin fi nuwan eduo kpata'ama afe azwalumizhi.
Surah 8:55 ,        For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are those who reject Him: They will not believe.,Hakika dabba na biye uma wuye gan mini dabbazhio na eba Soko'ona aga yi zanazhi-ajin kafirinci aci ye gan ajin imanianao.
Surah 8:56 ,          They are those with whom thou didst make a covenant but they break their covenant every time and they have not the fear (of Allah).,Zanazhi wyo pa alkawali be yin miniabo na gancin acia jin afe lo alkawali ya kandondo na ama'afe za nazhie tswa Sokoa amae sundan wyun'a na.
Surah 8:57  ,       If ye gain the mastery over them in war disperse with them those who follow them that they may remember.,To wyo ga bea tswo gwa mini ekun'o aala fe misali ya zazumaa'azhi ebo ala'abici ujin wo be wuncin'y uga afe sin san tu ya'a.
Surah 8:58    ,         If thou fearest treachery from any group throw back (their covenant) to them (so as to be) on equal terms: for Allah loveth not the treacherous.,Wyo ma gae be sundan yan (TITA) hainci dagan gwata jama'a ndoci zhio to a alkawalia ceya ya'a kendoe atso jin na: hakika Sokoe wa zanazhi gae jin hainci na'a.
Surah 8:59  ,     Let not the unbelievers think that they can get the better (of the godly): they will never frustrate (them).,Zanazhi ma'ajin kafirnci na aga fe kpa ye gan ayea gan gwa ma: hakika a gangwa'a.
Surah 8:60     ,                           Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power including steeds of war to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies of Allah and your enemies and others besides whom ye may not know but whom Allah doth know. Whatever ye shall spend in the cause of Allah shall be repaid unto you and ye shall not be treated unjustly.,Ye mae dan shiri boe ka'a be gwargwado yan yanna ye ga de kagbou yan kagbo na to doko yan ekun zhina ebo ye lae li makiyi Soko zhi dan to makiyi ye tso zhi to ndoci zhi nazhi jin ayeana ye kpea yea Soko de kpea ye yan dondo na ma ye ga wu fi eko Soko-ona Soko gaa egagba alheri shekpan ya ye ye ma'ade zana'ajin ye zwalunci na'a.
Surah 8:61    ,       But if the enemy incline towards peace do thou (also) incline towards peace and trust in Allah: for He is One that heareth and knoweth (all things).,Ama ga'ya kasan lo wi wa yan edun fe lafiya (be ye yin) to wyotso-oya kasan'olo wuncin wyomao lao yao kpe Soko: Hakika wyun ga yi Etsu na ma yi be kpi kpe yandondo nao Etsu na ma yi be kpikpe yandondoe na.
Surah 8:62   ,        Should they intend to deceive thee- verily Allah sufficeth thee: He it is That hath strengthened thee with His aid and with (the company of) the Believers;,Ama ga'akpa gan a'ta wyoe to hakika Soko tsa'kun ke ya wyo-yao wyun ga yi Etsu na gbo wyo ka be taimakou yin nao to be muminizhi nao.
Surah 8:63   ,                And (moreover) He hath put affection between their hearts: not if thou hadst spent all that is in the earth couldst thou have produced that affection but Allah hath done it: for He is Exalted in might Wise.,Ucia cin cin la'adan tsakani yangban'azhio be dozhi kada wyo ga yannazhifi kin bo kpatana wu ya'a wyo la cincin dan tsakani yangba yangban'azhio woa amma'ade Sokoa cincin la'adan tsakaniabo. Hakika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima ma uyio.
Surah 8:64 ,      O Prophet! sufficient unto thee is Allah- (unto thee) and unto those who follow thee among the Believers.,Ya wyoe Annabi! Sokoa kunke ya wyo ya'ani to zanazhi ga mi tu wyoe mini muminizhio na.Surah 8:65    ,                     O Prophet! rouse the Believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongst you patient and persevering they will vanquish two hundred: if a hundred they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers: for these are a people without understanding.,Ya wyoe Annabi! A evunba yan ekun la'alo dan yangban yan muminizhio a ga de eza 'shi mini yebo nazhia hankuri jin na aga'ade zankpe (galaba) ta eti eza kpako'a ama ga de eza shitsun mini yebo aga'a de zankpe ta eti za kpu'u tsun'o mini zanazhia jin kafirinci nao ebo na a'ezazhia ayio na egan'e ye ana.
Surah 8:65 ,                        O Prophet! rouse the Believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongst you patient and persevering they will vanquish two hundred: if a hundred they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers: for these are a people without understanding.,Ya wyoe Annabi! A evunba yan ekun la'alo dan yangban yan muminizhio a ga de eza 'shi mini yebo nazhia hankuri jin na aga'ade zankpe (galaba) ta eti eza kpako'a ama ga de eza shitsun mini yebo aga'a de zankpe ta eti za kpu'u tsun'o mini zanazhia jin kafirinci nao ebo na a'ezazhia ayio na egan'e ye ana.
Surah 8:66    ,                     For the present Allah hath lightened your (task) for He knoweth that there is a weak spot in you: But (even so) if there are a hundred of you patient and persevering they will vanquish two hundred and if a thousand they will vanquish two thousand with the leave of Allah: for Allah is with those who patiently persevere.,Gbani Sokoa sauki jin ya ye uma kpe-wo ke gbogun to wun'a lo ye na. Eboacin'o aga de eza shitsun na de hankurina dan mini ye bo aga'de(galaba) zankpe ta eti za kpako ama ga de za kpu'utsun mini ye bo aga'ade zankpeta eti za kpu'utsun gubae be izini Sokoe. Soko mae dan be zanazhi gae jin hankuri nae.
Surah 8:67 ,                  It is not fitting for a prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he hath thoroughly subdued the land. Ye look for the temporal goods of this world; but Allah looketh to the Hereafter: And Allah is Exalted in might Wise.,Ugwoyin ya Annabi ndondo na wyun'ade wuzhi zhi yan ekun na'a sai de uga gun kun ucia de zankpe ta eti kinbo. Ye ye kpa dide yan eyan zwoci yan izhe zhi Soko ma Etsu zan kpe uyio Etsu hikima ma uyio.
Surah 8:68   ,      Had it not been for a previous ordainment from Allah a severe penalty would have reached you for the (ransom) that ye took.,Kagan ujin ebo hukunci Sokona'ashidzo dan litafio na'a da'a azaba na gbota na gae de ebo yannazhi yegwo eti sisa'abo na.
Surah 8:69 ,         But (now) enjoy what ye took in war lawful and good: but fear Allah: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Eboacin'o egi mini ganima nazhi yega de ekun dao uci yi halali umayi wangi na. Ye mae tswa Soko be edansun' uyin hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu ye gun uyio.
Surah 8:69   ,       But (now) enjoy what ye took in war lawful and good: but fear Allah: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.,Eboacin'o egi mini ganima nazhi yega de ekun dao uci yi halali umayi wangi na. Ye mae tswa Soko be edansun' uyin hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu ye gun uyio.
Surah 8:70  ,                     O Prophet! say to those who are captives in your hands: "If Allah findeth any good in your hearts He will give you something better than what has been taken from you and He will forgive you: for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful."Ya wyoe Annabi! Gan ya za nazhi fi gwa ye bo ama yi za win wan ci zhi na: Soko ga tsun alheri fi mini yangban ye zhio wyun'a yae alheri natso gan yanna agwo be ye yin nae uma'ajin'e gafara. Soko ma Etsu ye gun uyio.
Surah 8:71 ,           But if they have treacherous designs against thee (O Messenger!) they have already been in treason against Allah and so hath He given (thee) power over them. And Allah so He Who hath (full) knowledge and wisdom.,Ama gae kpa gan ajin wyoe ha'ainci hakika ajin to Soko'otso hainci leani Soko cia wyo ya kagbo ta eti abo. Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio.
Surah 8:72  ,                                          Those who believed and adopted exile and fought for the Faith with their property and their persons in the cause of Allah as well as those who gave (them) asylum and aid- these are (all) friends and protectors one of another. As to those who believed but came not into exile ye owe no duty of protection to them until they come into exile; but if they seek your aid in religion it is your duty to help them except against a people with whom ye have a treaty of mutual alliance. And (remember) Allah seeth all that ye do.,Hakika zanazhia imani jin na aci kezhea kpe la (ke eyan de de lugwa) na aci jin jiadi (kokari) be dukiya'azhi to zanazhi twarya yan ecinbazhi na aci ke zhe jin taimako na za wuncin zhi maso yi zhi ayio ya dozhi. Zanazhi ma'a imani jin na ama kpe la'a na ye de yandoci na'abo ye keba be dozhi na'a sai kamina aga'a kpela na. Ama ga wa taimako be ye yin mini adinio ejin'a taimako sai de uga'azhe eti zandoci nazhi alkawali ndoci dan tsakani yebo bea yin na. Soko mae cin ye cin le be iri etun nazhi ye lo na.
Surah 8:73 ,           The Unbelievers are protectors one of another: Unless ye do this (protect each other) there would be tumult and oppression on earth and great mischief.,Zanazhi ma'ajin kafirinci na sashiazhi masoyi saashizhi ayio kagan ye jin acin'a (yeci wa dozhia) fitina ndoci ga'ajin tabatta dan kinbo gan-ni be eyan nyin na wancin nae.
Surah 8:74  ,               Those who believe and adopt exile and fight for the Faith in the cause of Allah as well as those who give (them) asylum and aid- these are (all) in very truth the Believers: for them is the forgiveness of sins and a provision most generous.,Zanazhi ma'a imani jin na acia kpe'la na aci jin jihadi (kokari) ta eti ekpa Soko ona to zanazhi twarya ecinbazhi (ya muhajiruzhi) na ama kezhe jin taimako na to za wuncinzhi gayi mumini yan gaskiya zhio gafara ga'jin tabbata ya'a to arziki na wancin na.
Surah 8:75 ,                    And those who accept Faith subsequently and adopt exile and fight for the Faith in your company- they are of you. But kindred by blood have prior rights against each other in the Book of Allah. Verily Allah is well-acquainted with all things.,Zanazhi ma ga imani jin dagan zumao na acia kpe la aci kezhe jin jihadi (kokari) keba be yeyin na to za wuncinzhi gayi zaba yezhio. Dangizhi-ma sashizhi tsoba dozhi gan sashi dan mini litafi Soko. Hakika Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio yan yandondo.
