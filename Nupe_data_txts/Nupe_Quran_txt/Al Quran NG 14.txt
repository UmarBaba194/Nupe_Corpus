 Surah 14:1      ,          A. L. R. A Book which We have revealed unto thee in order that thou mightest lead mankind out of the depths of darkness into light - by the leave of their Lord - to the Way of (Him) the Exalted in power worthy of all praise!-,ALIF LAM RA. (Alkuranu) Litafi uyio yi ma cin'u cin be ya wyoe ebo wyo la zawangizhio tin'oya dagan bazhikozhio lo haske be izini Tsocia yin lo eko yan Etsu nayi Etsu zankpe na Etsu na zandondoe jin yebo ya na.
Surah 14:2  ,           Of Allah to Whom do belong all things in the heavens and on earth! But alas for the Unbelievers for a terrible penalty (their Unfaith will bring them)!-,(Wyun ga yi) Soko Etsu na wun yannazhi fi sanmazhio to nazhi fi kinbo nao. Azaba yan zun yesun wun'ajin tabbata ya kafirizhi dagan mini azaba na gbota (acia finna).
Surah 14:3   ,            Those who love the life of this world more than the Hereafter who hinder (men) from the Path of Allah and seek therein something crooked: they are astray by a long distance.,Zanazhia cin-cin be boye la'a ya edunfe izhe cia gan yan eku na ama'ajin afe te eko Soko na aciajin afe wa kinkan'u na; za wuncinzhi fi mini egbin na'a kpe ya na.
Surah 14:4 ,                 We sent not a messenger except (to teach) in the language of his (own) people in order to make (things) clear to them. Now Allah leaves straying those whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases: and He is Exalted in power full of Wisdom.,Yima la'a tun Tuci tun lea sai de be zhimi jama'a yan'uzhi ebo'ujin bayani (yandondo-u) ya; gancin Soko cie gbin zana ga bau na uma'ajin'Ula za na ga bauna ke eko.

Surah 14:5                    We sent Moses with Our signs (and the command). "Bring out thy people from the depths of da,rkness into light and teach them to remember the Days of Allah." Verily in this there are Signs for such as are firmly patient and constant- grateful and appreciative.,Hikika ma yi tun Musa tun be aya Yizhi kede; Da jama'a yan wyozhi kutinya dagan bazhikozhio lo haske.

Surah 14:6 ,                        Remember! Moses said to his people: "Call to mind the favour of Allah to you when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: they set you hard tasks and punishments slaughtered your sons and let your women-folk live: therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.",Wyo mao pa kamina Musa fe gan ya jama'a yan'uzhi gan: E pa ni'ima Soko na ta eti yebo na kamina ugan ye gwa dagan egun jama'a fir'aunazhio na E yaye azaba dede fin aciajin afe zun egi bagi yezhi acie la yinzagizhi ya be rayia yin.

Surah 14:9 ,                                   Has not the story reached you (O people!) of those who (went) before you - of the people of Noah and ´Ad and Thamud - And of those who (came) after them None knows them but Allah. To them came messengers with Clear (Signs); but they put their hands up to their mouths and said: "We do deny (the mission) on which ye have been sent and we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which ye invite us.",Kashi labari zanazhi zhiyedzo na be ya ye yea (ke) yan jama'a yan Nuhu to Adu to Samudi na to zanazhi be dan zunma'abo na Zandondo kpea kpea yea sai egwa'azhi la'afi misun'azhio (a sun-sun) aci gan: Hakika yi yia jin kafirinci be yanna a tun ye tun be yin nae hakika ma yi yie jin shakka be yannazhi ye yi yi gan yi be'y tsun na yangban yi mae ceka.
Surah 14:10  ,                              Their messengers said: "Is there a doubt about Allah The Creator of the heavens and the earth It is He Who invites you in order that He may forgive you your sins and give you respite for a term appointed!" They said: "Ah! ye are no more than human like ourselves! Ye wish to turn us away from the (gods) our fathers used to worship: then bring us some clear authority.",Tuciazhi ci gan: "Ngba kelo kezhin ndoci danbo eti Soko Etsu na tswa sanmazhi to kin na Wyun'e yi ye yi ebo u fa be zunubi yezhi umau patau yaye har da lokaci nayi bibacina."

Surah 14:11  ,                          Their messengers said to them: "True we are human like yourselves but Allah doth grant His grace to such of his servants as He pleases. It is not for us to bring you an authority except as Allah permits. And on Allah let all men of faith put their trust.,Tuciazhi cigan: Yi yi yandondoa sai de zawangi naynci yezhi ama'ade Soko wyun'ajin ula eryatwa'u ya zana ga bau mini wuzhiu zhio na.

Surah 14:12 ,               "No reason have we why we should not put our trust on Allah. Indeed He Has guided us to the Ways we (follow). We shall certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us. For those who put their trust should put their trust on Allah.",Ki'I ma'a kan yi cia ya kpe Sokoa yin'o uma yi wuba ta eti eko wangi yan yi bo Hakika ma yiga hakuri jin eti egun nazhi ye jin yi na.

Surah 14:14,         "And verily We shall cause you to abide in the land and succeed them. This for such as fear the Time when they shall stand before My tribunal- such as fear the punishment denounced.",Yima ga ye la'a fedun dan kin miabo zunma'abo. Wuncin ma ga'ajin tabbata jin ya zana gae sundan gbarogi yegboro mibo na umae sundan azaba Mi na.
Surah 14:15 ,   But they sought victory and decision (there and then) and frustration was the lot of every powerful obstinate transgressor.,Aci ba aduwa yan eko kpe be nasarae. Zaeni ndondo na yi etikagboci ragbanzhi ci na cia gba (a jin hallaka)
Surah 14:16 ,     In front of such a one is Hell and he is given for drink boiling fetid water.,Zunma wuncin'o jahannama cia gba'a zunma acia yan nuwan fin dagan nuwan etin zhio.
Surah 14:16,      In front of such a one is Hell and he is given for drink boiling fetid water.,Zunma wuncin'o jahannama cia gba'a zunma acia yan nuwan fin dagan nuwan etin zhio.
Surah 14:17,               In gulps will he sip it but never will he be near swallowing it down his throat: death will come to him from every quarter yet will he not die: and in front of him will be a chastisement unrelenting.,Ucia fe din'ufin uma'a woma nyin-nyin wun'a ajali cia fe be yau dagan eko ndondo (gun enao) uma'a tsua gancin ma zunmaubo azaba tsuntsun nu danbo.
Surah 14:18  ,                   The parable of those who reject their Lord is that their works are as ashes on which the wind blows furiously on a tempestuous day: No power have they over aught that they have earned: that is the straying far far (from the goal).,Kotonci yan zanazhi jin kafirinci be Tsocia yin nae etun'azhi ke tutunpare na uyio na efe ku dan mini efo dundufe ko na acide kagbo ndondo eti etun kiriki na'a lo na boa.

Surah 14:19 ,            Seest thou not that Allah created the heavens and the earth in Truth If He so will He can remove you and put (in your place) a new creation,Kashi wyo le yea kede Soko jin alitta sanmazhi to kin jin eti gaskiyao na'a Uga bau uga ye fin-ya ucia be be alitta woroe.
Surah 14:20  ,  Nor is that for Allah any great matter.,Wuncin majin yan na zwo eba Soko-o naa.
Surah 14:21 ,                                They will all be marshalled before Allah together: then will the weak say to those who were arrogant "For us we but followed you; can ye then avail us to all against the wrath of Allah" They will reply "If we had received the Guidance of Allah we should have given it to you: to us it makes no difference (now) whether we rage or bear (these torments) with patience: for ourselves there is no way of escape.",Kpataa ciga tin ya gi yegboro Soko (Efo Alkiyami) gancin eza gbogunzhi ciagan be zanazhi gbotika kpe kinbo na gan: Hakika yi yia fe zanazhi fe gbaye (izheo na) ngba ye kunke yayi wo be yandoci ke azaba Soko lugwa wo Agan: soko ga wu yitso ba wu da yitsoa wu yeba.

Surah 14:22     ,                                      And Satan will say when the matter is decided: "It was Allah Who gave you a promise of Truth: I too promised but I failed in my promise to you. I had no authority over you except to call you but ye listened to me: then reproach not me but reproach your own souls. I cannot listen to your cries nor can ye listen to mine.

Surah 14:23       ,         But those who believe and work righteousness will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow- to dwell therein for aye with the leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: "Peace!",Acia zanazhia imani jin aci lotun gurunzhina la'a gandan Aljannazhio nazhi nuwan edu zhie je fi takoabo na. Ba ga bo afi tutun yin'o be izini Tsocia yin'o.

Surah 14:24              Seest thou not how Allah sets forth a parable - A goodly word like a goodly tree whose root is firmly, fixed and its branches (reach) to the heavens- of its Lord. So Allah sets forth parables for men in order that they may receive admonition.,Wyo le kendoe Soko la misali la be na'a Egan lilici (man-nagi) ke cigban mannagi na uyio gbereu wun'a wankin wangi gwalauzhi ma kpe sanmao.
Surah 14:25    ,       It brings forth its fruit at all times by the leave of its Lord. So Allah sets forth parables for men in order that they may receive admonition.,Ucie la yangici sun-sun'uzhi ya zazhi kan dondo be izini Tsoci'uyin. Soko mae la misali la ya zazhi ebo be wuncin'y ala'a san'atu.
Surah 14:26,            And the parable of an evil Word is that of an evil tree: It is torn up by the root from the surface of the earth: it has no stability.Misali yan egan dede ma ke cigban dede na uyio na'a waya dagan eti kinbo ucide egi ba'a na.
Surah 14:27   ,              Allah will establish in strength those who believe with the word that stands firm in this world and in the Hereafter; but Allah will leave to stray those who do wrong: Allah doeth what He willeth.,Soko ajin ugbo kinigiba yan zanazhia imani jin na ka be egan na gbo ka nae dan mini edun fe izheo to Alkiyamio.

Surah 14:31,                    Speak to my servants who have believed that they may establish regular prayers and spend (in charity) out of the sustenance we have given them secretly and openly before the coming of a Day in which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.,Gan ya wuzhi mizhi nazhia imani jin na gan ala salla'a kua gikini ama'a wu dukiya'a mini nazhi yila arzikiu ya'a na (fi eko Soko) to swiswoci to gbangba tun kafi Efo na woce to eyada danboa na ube na.

Surah 14:34 ,             And He giveth you of all that ye ask for. But if ye count the favours of Allah never will ye be able to number them.
