Surah 36:1, Ya Sin.,YASIN. (Bayanizhi shidzo eti'u bo'ani).
Surah 36:2 ,By the Qur´an full of Wisdom-,Mi'e zhi kuti be Alkuranuy nan'ashe be hikimae nan.
Surah 36:3 , Thou art indeed one of the messengers,Akika Wyoe (Muhammadu) wyo dan mini Tucizhio.Surah 36:4  On a Straight Way.Wyo ta eti ekpa nantso yi gboro nan.Surah 36:5  It is a Revelation sent down by (Him) the Exalted in Might Most Merciful.(Alkur'anu) ma u cin cin be dagan eba Soko nan yi Etsu zankpe nan Etsu yegun.
Surah 36:6    ,  In order that thou mayest admonish a people whose fathers had received no admonition and who therefore remain heedless (of the Signs of Allah).,Ebo wyo jin gangba'o ya jama'a nanzhi a jin gangba ya yanmanci'azhi'a nan a cia fe dan eye-yao-na.
Surah 36:7   ,    The Word is proved true against the greater part of them: for they do not believe.,Akika hukunci Soko (azaba) a jin tabbata eti kundondoa bo ebo nan ya gaskiya'a na.
Surah 36:8       ,  We have put yokes round their necks right up to their chins so that their heads are forced up (and they cannot see),Akika Yi'a kuruzhi ku fia kpatsun'azhio har da da'a wan nungbeazhi ebo acin'o eti'azhi a kan ta fitio.
Surah 36:9   ,        And We have put a bar in front of them and a bar behind them and further We have covered them up; so that they cannot see.,Yi cia yekan la'a dan yegboro'a bo yekan ma'dan to zunma'abo Yi cia eyan la a'rukpe'a aci le ba ye bea.
Surah 36:10 ,      The same is it to them whether thou admonish them or thou do not admonish them: they will not believe.,Ye-ni ma'u yi eba'abo ko wyo jin'a gangba ko ma wyo ga jin'a ma ajin za nanzhi a ya gaskiya na'a.
Surah 36:11   ,        Thou canst but admonish such a one as follows the Message and fears the (Lord) Most Gracious unseen: give such a one therefore good tidings of Forgiveness and a Reward most generous.,Akika wyoe jin gangba jin ya za nan gae la mitu foro Alkur'ani nan u mae kezhe sundan Soko swiswociy nan (Annabi) ya'u labari yangban fa be gafara yan Sokoe to lada nan wancin nan.
Surah 36:12    ,         Verily We shall give life to the dead and We record that which they send before and that which they leave behind and of all things have We taken account in a clear Book (of evidence).,Akika Yi gaela rayi dan eyan tsutsucizhio Yi ma ga etun nan zhi a la shidzo nan ka to ekpa nanzhiy a da nan. Yandondo ma Yi'u jin lisafi dan mini litafi nan wancin uma yi gbangba na.
Surah 36:13  ,     Set forth to them by way of a parable the (story of) the Companions of the City. Behold! there came messengers to it.,Wyo mao la misali'o wu'a yan jama'a yan alkarya ndoci ka mi nan Tucizhi be ya'a na.
Surah 36:14,          When We (first) sent to them two messengers they rejected them: But We strengthened them with a third: they said "Truly we have been sent on a mission to you.",Ka mi nan Yi tun Tuci guba fi'a nan a cia egan'azhi yi gasmanan Yi ci'a be kagbo be za taci'y a ci gan; Akika yi de Tucizhi yi-yi be ebaye-yeo.
Surah 36:15    ,          The (people) said: "Ye are only men like ourselves; and (Allah) Most Gracious sends no sort of revelation: ye do nothing but lie.",A ci gan: ye yi za'ndo'a sai dai zawangi dozhin yi  Soko (ALRAHMANU) ma cin yan'ndondo be'a ye de ganmanan tsaba u ga ye zun'o.
Surah 36:16 ,    They said: "Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you:,A ci gan: "Tsoci-yi u yi be kpikpe ke de Tucizhi yi'yi be eba ye ye'o nao.
Surah 36:17  ,  "And our duty is only to proclaim the clear Message.",Etun-ndo ma ta eti yi bo'a sai dai yanwu nan yi be bayani'y nan.
Surah 36:18     ,      The (people) said: "for us we augur an evil omen from you: if ye desist not we will certainly stone you. And a grievous punishment indeed will be inflicted on you by us.",A ci gan: "Yi ye cin'ye le eza de dezhi kagan ma ye lugwa'a yi gae ce yan ye ma ga'gun be azaba nan tan-nan dagan eba yi bo.
Surah 36:19  ,      They said: "Your evil omens are with yourselves: (deem ye this an evil omen). If ye are admonished Nay but ye are a people transgressing all bounds!",A ci gan: cincinle yan eyan dedeyezhi u dan ganni be ye tsoe kashi ebo tukpa nan a paye nan (u ga la ye ci gan acin'o) A'a ye de fe'a saidaiza nanzhi'e nyin yanzhi nan.
Surah 36:20     ,    Then there came running from the farthest part of the City a man saying "O my people! Obey the messengers:,Eza bagi ndoci ci be dagan efu nanlokpa gan mini ezhio nao u fe dinye u ci gan: Ya ye jamaazhi ya emi tu Tucizhi.
Surah 36:21   ,   "Obey those who ask no reward of you (for themselves) and who have themselves received Guidance.,Yea emi tu za nazhi e gbin ye gan yan lada etun'azhi a nana ma kezhe yi eza eko gboro nan (eza bawuzhi nan).
Surah 36:22    ,   "It would not be reasonable in me if I did not serve Him Who created me and to Whom ye shall (all) be brought back.,Kiy-ma a kan mi cia jin bawta ya Etsu nanjin alita mi yin'a naa yin'o ezhekeba ye kpata ma u dan eba u bo
Surah 36:23     ,         "Shall I take (other) gods besides Him If (Allah) Most Gracious should intend some adversity for me of no use whatever will be their intercession for me nor can they deliver me.,Ngba mi ga za'ndoci baci Soko la gan wyun gayi ndakatao Ngan Soko (ALRAHMANU) wun'a kpa mimacinle ndoci be mi yin gwatan yan zandodo'a wun'a jin mi amfania a ma bo mi yawo'a.
Surah 36:24  ,  "I would indeed if I were to do so be in manifest Error.,Akika mi ga jin acin mi ga'fe dan mini egbin'o nantso a tu la na.
Surah 36:25,   "For me I have faith in the Lord of you (all): listen then to me!",Akika mi'a imanijin ganni be Tsoci ye yin ye mae laefe erie ya mi.
Surah 36:26  ,    It was said: "Enter thou the Garden." He said: "Ah me! Would that my People knew (what I know)!-,Aci gan'u gan: "A gandan Aljannao. U gan: kasa! da'aci gan jamaa yan mizhi de kpikpe (yan alhairi na Soko jin ya mi nan).
Surah 36:27   ,   "For that my Lord has granted me Forgiveness and has enrolled me among those held in honour!",To fi-fa nan u fa be mi yin nae U ci kezhe-a mi la'adan ezacinwancizhio.
Surah 36:28   ,         And We sent not down against his People after him any hosts from heaven nor was it needful for Us so to do.,Yi ma cin ekun-gunci ndondo be ya jamaa yan'u zhi zunma'u boa Yi ma cin be le'a.
Surah 36:29  ,     It was no more than a single mighty Blast and behold! they were (like ashes) quenched and silent.,Alamaria u fe'a sai dai kabara nini kpata ci'a fe eza tsutsucizhi.
Surah 36:30    ,      Ah! Alas for (My) Servants! There comes not a messenger to them but they mock him!,Egiti yan robonkpe wun'ajin tabbata ta eti wuzhizhio kami-ndondo nan tuci gabe ya'anan aa fe za nazhi e la'u mi nan.
Surah 36:31  ,        See they not how many generations before them we destroyed Not to them will they return:,Kashi a le ba yele'a ekun dondo za nanzhi Yi jin'a hallaka shi'a dzo mini alummazhio na akika Za wuncinzhi a kezhe zhin eba'a be'a.
Surah 36:32  ,   But each one of them all - will be brought before Us (for judgment).,Akika ma kpata a gaa ku ye kanbe zhi yegboro Yi bo.
Surah 36:33    ,     A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life and produce grain therefrom of which ye do eat.,U ma dan mini egwa wu yan zankpe Soko ya'a Kin na'a tsu nan yi'u dan rayi yi cia yangi-ci sun-sunzhi la'atin yardagan mini'u bo U cia fe yangici nanzhi e gi nan.
Surah 36:34    ,     And We produce therein orchard with date-palms and vines and We cause springs to gush forth therein:,Yi cikezhea lati yan dobinazhi jin dan nin'yin'u bo to yangici inabizhi Yi ci kezhea eye nuwanzhi la'atinya fi mini'u bo.
Surah 36:35   ,    That they may enjoy the fruits of this (artistry): It was not their hands that made this: will they not then give thanks,Ebo a fea de'agi dagan yangici sun-sun'uzhio to nazhi a tso ga la egwazhi ci lo'tun'u nan. Ngba za'nnazhi'a jin yebo ya Soko'a
Surah 36:36  ,          Glory to Allah Who created in pairs all things that the earth produces as well as their own (human) kind and (other) things of which they have no knowledge.,Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu na'a alittazhi kpata jin eba be yiwo'e nan. Dagan mini yannanzhi yin tin-ya kinbo na to mini 'atso (Zawangizhio) to yannazhi a de kpikpe wun'a nan.
Surah 36:37    ,    And a Sign for them is the Night: We withdraw therefrom the Day and behold they are plunged in darkness;,U ma dan mini egwa wu yan zankpe Soko yeshi na Yi'a jin yi wa ebatin tin'ya dagan mini'u bo na alittazhi ci gaa fe dan mini bazhiko.
Surah 36:38  ,     And the sun runs his course for a period determined for him: that is the decree of (Him) the Exalted in Might the All-Knowing.,To igidi'otso wun'ajin u fe bi ci da iyaka yan ecinba'u. Nan-nan shiri u yio yan Soko na yi Etsu zankpe nan an yi Etsu kpikpe nan.
Surah 36:39   ,   And the Moon- We have measured for her mansions (to traverse) till she returns like the old (and withered) lower part of a date-stalk.,To etswa'o tso yi'a ecinbazhi tswa cigban dobina gbako na.
Surah 36:40   ,           It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon nor can the Night outstrip the Day: Each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law).,Wun'a ye jin ya igidi nan wun'a tso etswa na'a yeshi maashi batin dzo'a ndondo'a ma gun mini falakio a cie je za.
Surah 36:41    ,   And a Sign for them is that We bore their race (through the Flood) in the loaded Ark;,U ma dan mini egwa wu yan zankpe Soko ya'a yi'a zuriya'azhi ku fi mini eya'o nan yi shisheci nan.
Surah 36:42    , And We have created for them similar (vessels) on which they ride.,Yi ma kejin in'u zhi ya'a nan a fe de tu nan.
Surah 36:43  ,      If it were Our Will We could drown them: then would there be no helper (to hear their cry) nor could they be delivered,U ma ga ba yi yi gaajin hallaka fi mini edwo a ma'a de za nan'ajin'a taimako na'a a ma ade zanan'a wo'a tin-ya na'a
Surah 36:44,     Except by way of Mercy from Us and by way of (world) convenience (to serve them) for a time.,Sai de yegan dagan eba yi bo be emawo yan etapa daaeka ndoci.
Surah 36:45,          When they are told "Fear ye that which is before you and that which will be after you in order that ye may receive Mercy" (they turn back),.A ma ga gan ya'gan: "e sundan yan alamari na ci ye gboro'e bo na to nan tso dan zunmae bo nan be'acin ma Soko'a gun'e ye.
Surah 36:46     ,     Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord but they turn away therefrom.,A ya ndondo na ga be ya' dangan mini aya yan Soko zhio na a'jin a zunma zhe ta.Surah 36:46          Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord but they turn away therefrom.A ya ndondo na ga be ya' da,ngan mini aya yan Soko zhio na a'jin a zunma zhe ta.
Surah 36:47                       And when they are told "Spend ye of (the bounties) with which Allah has provided you" the Unbelievers say to those who believe: "Shall we then feed those whom if Allah had so willed He would have fed (Himself)- Ye are in nothing but manifest error.",A ma ga gan yaagan: "efe wu dukiya yezhi mini nanzhi Soko la arziki'u ya ye nan (fi eko guru'o) Za nanzhi ajin kafirinci nan'a gan be za tsaabe la yangici ya za nan u ga be Soko gan wun'a ya'ugi u gaaya'u gi nao Akika (eza iri nazhi) a fe'a sai de dan mini egbin nan'a tulanao.
Surah 36:48  ,    Further they say "When will this promise (come to pass) if what ye say is true",A ma'jin a fe gan gan: Fo ci alkawali (yan alkiyami) a yio wun'ayi gaskiya tsa ye tao nao
Surah 36:49  ,     They will not (have to) wait for aught but a single Blast: it will seize them while they are yet disputing among themselves!,Yando danbo nan e tu ye na'a. sai de kabara ninikete. Nan a dzun dzun fia lokaci nan mini ekoce yan eyan wa yan izeo nao.
Surah 36:50 ,     No (chance) will they then have by will to dispose (of their affairs) nor to return to their own people!Kanga a'de iko yan wasiyya jin'a a ma'ade ezhe ke lo eba iyaliazhi bea.,Surah 36:51         The trumpet shall be sounded when behold! from the sepulchres (men) will rush forth to their Lord!Aci ga kafo be gancin a cia fe gu tinya dagan kabarizhio a cia fe lo eba Tsocia.
Surah 36:52    ,       They will say: "Ah! Woe unto us! Who hath raised us up from our beds of repose"... (A voice will say:) "This is what (Allah) Most Gracious had promised. And true was the word of the messengers!",A cia gan gan: Kasaayi re! zae yi za na nan-yi-kin dagan elele ba yi bo nao (A cia ya'ezhe gan: Ngan nan-nan ga yi yannan Soko Etsu yegun fe la jin yi alkawali nao Tucizhi ma a gaskiya ta.
Surah 36:53 ,        It will be no more than a single Blast when lo! they will all be brought up before Us!,Akika alamari nan-nan ufe'a sai de kabara nini ke gancin kpata ci gaa gun yekan zhi yagboro Yi bo.Surah 36:54          Then on that Day not a soul will be wronged in the least and ye shall but be repaid the meeds of your past Deeds.Yinnan nnan aajin rayi ndondo egun ndondoa a maa ga'e gbaa sai de be iri etun nanzhi ye fe lo (izheo)nan.
Surah 36:55   ,   Verily the Companions of the Garden shall that Day have joy in all that they do;,Akika za mi Aljannazhi yinnan afedan mini shagalio a maa fe wo man.

Surah 36:57  ,   (Every) fruit (enjoyment) will be there for them; they shall have whatever they call for;,A ma yi be yangici mari-marizhi fi nini yan'u bo a ma yibe yan dondo nan a gae wa nan.Surah 36:58    "Peace!" - a word (of salutation) from a Lord Most Merciful!Emisa yan aminci ugaafe egan na afe be ya' dagan eba Tsoci nan yi Etsu yegun nan'
Surah 36:59  , "And O ye in sin! Get ye apart this Day!,Ye mae la'ekpe kayin yin'na ya ye lefi jinci zhi.Surah 36:60            "Did I not enjoin on you O ye Children of Adam that ye should not worship Satan; for that he was to you an enemy avowed-A sa mi jin ye gangbaa ya ye egi Adamazhi kede ye ga jin bauta ya shaitan ma'a Akika makiu ye u yio yan gbangba.
Surah 36:61 ,   "And that ye should worship Me (for that) this was the Straight Way,Ye mae fe jin bautae ya Mi nan-nan ga yi ekpa nantso yi gboro nao.
Surah 36:62    ,   "But he did lead astray a great multitude of you. Did ye not then understand,Akika ma (shaitan) wun'a jama'a nanzhi dokun nan gbin kiy la ye ci gaa fe eza ankalizhia yin'o

Surah 36:65     ,     That Day shall We set a seal on their mouths. But their hands will speak to us and their feet bear witness to all that they did.,Yinnan-nnan Yi ga misun'azhi te egwaazhi cia gangan be Yi yin bicia zhi ma'ajin ri etun nanzhi a fe lo nan.
Surah 36:66      ,  If it had been our Will We could surely have blotted out their eyes; then should they have run about groping for the Path but how could they have seen,U ma ga ba Yi Yiga eyeazhi fin ya a cia fe sanganna be eciy ta eti kpandara swiratio ke'a dada ci le ba ye nao
Surah 36:67  ,       And if it had been Our Will We could have transformed them (to remain) in their places; then should they have been unable to move about nor could they have returned (after error).,U ga ba Yi Yi ga'fin ya ba nanzhi a kpe nao acia de ba lo yegboroa amaa zhin zunma woa.
Surah 36:68   ,   If We grant long life to any We cause him to be reversed in nature: Will they not then understand,Za nan ma yi ga yau rayi kpalo nan yi ga halittau zhegba daake yan dzakanbo nan kashi a de ankali dea
Surah 36:69 ,          We have not instructed the (Prophet) in Poetry nor is it meet for him: this is no less than a Message and a Qur´an making things clear:,Yi ma la eniko wu Annabi Muhammadua. U ma -- yin ya wun'a yan nan ube beyin nan U fea sai de sinsantu ganni be Alkur'anu nan'a tula nan.
Surah 36:70  ,     That it may give admonition to any (who are) alive and that the charge may be proved against those who reject (Truth),.Ebo ujin gangba'u ya za nan ga yi be rayiy nan ( uga yi Muminio) azaba ma ga-jin tabbata ta eti kafirizhio.
Surah 36:71     ,      See they not that it is We Who have created for them - among the things which Our hands have fashioned - cattle which are under their dominion,-Kashi! A le ye kendoe Yi jin halitta yan dabba emawozhi jin ya'a be egwa Yi yin na'a Acia fe yan nanzhi e jin mulkia na'a

Surah 36:72 ,    And that We have subjected them to their (use) of them some do carry them and some they eat:Yi cia jin foro ya'a ebo anfani'abo) acie de yan'a tu za a mae kezhe de gigi dagan mini'ubo.
Surah 36:73  ,   And they have (other) profits from them (besides) and they get (milk) to drink. Will they not then be grateful,A mae de eyan anfani mini'abo to eyan fin-fincizhi. Ngba aajin yebo ya sokoa
Surah 36:73  ,   And they have (other) profits from them (besides) and they get (milk) to drink. Will they not then be grateful,A mae de eyan anfani mini'abo to eyan fin-fincizhi. Ngba aajin yebo ya sokoa
Surah 36:74   ,   Yet they take (for worship) gods other than Allah (hoping) that they might be helped!Acie da wun kuti ndocizhi ke Soko lugwa ebo kutizhia jin'a taimako.
Surah 36:75 ,     They have not the power to help them: but they will be brought up (before Our Judgment-seat) as a troop (to be condemned).,Kutizhi ma jin'a taimako ndondo woa atso kafirizhi tsa yi kagbo nan zhie tswa kutizhi nao.
Surah 36:76     ,   Let not their speech then grieve thee. Verily We know what they hide as well as what they disclose.,Ga lugwa egan'azhi yin wyo yangban ma akika Yi de kpikpe yan nanzhie so nan to nanzhi a la tula nan.
Surah 36:77  ,        Doth not man see that it is We Who created him from sperm yet behold! he (stands forth) as an open adversary!,Zawangi leye lea ke de Yi ga jin halittau dagan maniy bo naa U ci kezhe be'azhe za nan'e sun'wun cie gbomi be alamari Sokoe nan.
Surah 36:78    ,      And he makes comparisons for Us and forgets his own (origin and) Creation: He says "Who can give life to (dry) bones and decomposed ones (at that)",Har u gan win'e la egan wu yi be misali jin'y ucia to kendoe Soko jin halittau jin nan batan Uci gan: Ngba ziy dan tsukun rayi wo beo kaminan u ga ban cia gi ya zo nao
Surah 36:79 ,        Say "He will give them life Who created them for the first time! for He is Well-versed in every kind of creation!-,Gan gan: Etsu wuncin nan la rayi yau cabae nan u dan'u rayi wo be. Akika Etsu uyio nan de kpikpe yan jinjin halitta irindondo nan.

Surah 36:81 ,            "Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like thereof" - Yea indeed! for He is the Creator Supreme of skill and knowledge (infinite)!,Ngba Etsu nanjin halitta sanmazhi to kin nan u de kagbo nan uga' jin iriu wo be na'a Akika Soko gayi Etsu nan ejin halitta kpata nao Etsu kpikpe ma uyio.
Surah 36:82 ,        Verily when He intends a thing His Command is "be" and it is!,Akika ma alamari Soko kandondo nan eyan ga bau yin jin nan wun'ajin u gan'u gan: "a fe" uci ga fe (kendoe ugae bau nan).
