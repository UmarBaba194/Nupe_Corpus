Acinga gao kara nazhi ala na wun'a biye.
Surah 16:26 ,                   Those before them did also plot (against Allah´s Way): but Allah took their structures from their foundations and the roof fell down on them from above; and the Wrath seized them from directions they did not perceive.,Hakika zanazhi shiadzo na ajin shiri yan makirinci Soko cia emi nazhia tu na gbin ya dagan ekpouzhio yannazhi a la kpeu na cia kpan be kpea dagan titaabo azaba ci dabe ya'a dagan bana a kpayetua na.
Surah 16:27 ,                   Then on the Day of Judgment He will cover them with shame and say: "Where are My ´partners´ concerning whom ye used to dispute (with the godly)" Those endued with knowledge will say: "This Day indeed are the Unbelievers covered with shame and misery-,Gancin ma Efo Alkiyami Soko ga'a sunzunye u cia gangan: Ba zanazhi ye la pa mi baci ye cie gbomi etiabo na dan'o Zanazhi ye la pa mi baci ye cie gbomi etiabo na dan'o Zanazhi ala kpikpe yana cigan:Hakika zunyesun be yangbonyin dede ajin tabbata ya kafirizhi.
Surah 16:28   ,               "(Namely) those whose lives the angels take in a state of wrong-doing to their own souls." Then would they offer submission (with the pretence) "We did no evil (knowingly)." (The angels will reply) "Nay but verily Allah knoweth all that ye did;(A g a y I ) ,zanazhi kamina malaikazhi gea -- rayi bea yin na aafe zanazhia eti tacin'ajin zwalunci na atso ciga kpatsun ta acia gangan: yi ma fe za nazhie lo tun dede ndoci na'ani.

Surah 16:30    ,               To the righteous (when) it is said "What is it that your Lord has revealed" they say "All that is good." To those who do good there is good in this world and the Home of the Hereafter is even better and excellent indeed is the Home of the righteous-,Acia gan be zanazhi sundan Soko na gan: ki'I Tsoci ye cin beo Agan: " Alheri" Zanazhi ga lo tun wangi dan izhe na nao na ade egagba wangizhi egagba yan Alkiyami ma gan. Madan-la be emi (Aljanna) yan zanazhie sundan Soko na.
Surah 16:31 ,             Gardens of Eternity which they will enter: beneath them flow (pleasant) rivers: they will have therein all that they wish: thus doth Allah reward the righteous-,Ugayi Emi Aljannazhi yan eman-wo aga gan fi bo nuwan managi eduzhi cia fe je fi tako abo ayibe eyan waci ndondoe fiminiabo. Acinga ga Sokoe la egagba ya zanazhi gae sundan'u acie tswau nao.
Surah 16:32  ,         (Namely) those whose lives the angels take in a state of purity saying (to them) "Peace be on you; enter ye the Garden because of (the good) which ye did (in the world).",( A g a y I ) zanazhi kamina malaikazhi gae -- rayi beayin na afi mini yangban fao nao acia fe gan gan: Aminci Soko u laujin tabbata u yaye eganda Aljannao ebo iri etun (wangizhi)nazhi ye fe lo izheo nao.
Surah 16:33   ,                  Do the (ungodly) wait until the angels come to them or there comes the Command of thy Lord (for their doom) So did those who went before them. But Allah wronged them not: nay they wronged their own souls.,Ngan yandondo danbo na (kafirizhi) e tu ye na'a sai de Malaikazhi (nazhia la azaba be ya na) koma foro yan Tsoci wyoe ndoci na'abe yaa na acinga ga zanazhi be shiadzo na jin'o. Soko ma jin'a zwaluncia atso tsa jin ti tacin'a zwaluncio.
Surah 16:34,         But the evil results of their deeds overtook them and that very (Wrath) at which they had scoffed hemmed them in.,Egagba dede yan etun dede na'alona cia de yannazhi ma afe lami na cia ma -- ba.
Surah 16:35     ,                          The worshippers of false gods say: "If Allah had so willed we should not have worshipped aught but Him - neither we nor our fathers- nor should we have prescribed prohibitions other than His." So did those who went before them. But what is the mission of messengers but to preach the Clear Message,Zanazhi la yan pa Soko baci na gan: "wun'a ba Soko ba da yi yia jin bauta ya zandondo baci Soko boa to yi to yanmanciyizhi da yi maa la yandoci azhe haramu baci na Soko la jin haramu na boa" Acinga ga zanazhi be shiadzo na jin'o. Ngan yandondo ta eti Tuci boa saide eyan-wu yan gbangba.
Surah 16:36   ,                        For We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger (with the Command) "Serve Allah and eschew Evil": of the People were some whom Allah guided and some on whom error became inevitably (established). So travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who denied (the Truth).,Hakika ma yi tun Tuci tun dan mini alumma ndondo kede: "Ejin bauta ya Soko ye mae kpe ya be shetan yin nae." Miniabo ade nazhi Sokoa wuba na amade dan miniabo nazhi egbin'ajin tabbata ta etiabo na (harda fo mi ajaliana). Ebo acin'o edazan kpe eti kinbo ye mae cin'ele elo kendoe zoba yan ganmana zuncizhi yi yi na.
Surah 16:37,             If thou art anxious for their guidance yet Allah guideth not such as He leaves to stray and there is none to help them.,Ka da ma wyogae bavun eti ekokeabo to hakika Sokoe la zana ugaa gbin na ke ekoa amade zandondo danbo naajin'a taimako naa.
Surah 16:38  ,               They swear their strongest oaths by Allah that Allah will not raise up those who die: Nay but it is a promise (binding) on Him in truth: but most among mankind realise it not.,Ama zhi kuti be Sokoe lo iyaka yan gaskiya boa (na'akpena) kede: zana ga'atsu na Sokoa na'akin bea na. A'a ujin acin'a (ekin na Alkiyami) alkawali uyio yan gaskiya na Soko jin na amaade ekun dondo zawangizhi kpea.
Surah 16:39 ,         (They must be raised up) in order that He may manifest to them the truth of that wherein they differ and that the rejecters of Truth may realise that they had indeed (surrendered to) Falsehood.,(Soko ga alittazhi la nakin) Ebo ujin bayani'uya'a yan yannazhi aga cedozhi leba etiubo na ebo ma to kafirizhia kpeawo kede hakika aya'afe ganmana zuncizhi na.
Surah 16:40 ,        For to anything which We have willed We but say the word "Be" and it is.,Hakika yanna yia jin yi gan be yandoci kamina Yi ga kpa gan Yia jin'u na yia jin yi gangan: " Afe" Uci ga'afe ga.
Surah 16:41  ,               To those who leave their homes in the cause of Allah after suffering oppression- We will assuredly give a goodly home in this world; but truly the reward of the Hereafter will be greater. If they only realised (this)!,Zanazhi maga kpe la ebo Soko baci na aga jin'a zwalunci na hakika yi ga izhe le wangi jin shiri ya'a egagba yan Alkiyami ma u wancin gan agaafe zanazhi de kpikpe de na.
Surah 16:42  ,  (They are) those who persevere in patience and put their trust on their Lord.,(Agayi) zanazhia hakuri jin nao amaafe zanazhie yakpe Tsocia (dan alamari ndondo nao).
Surah 16:43   ,           And before thee also the messengers We sent were but men to whom We granted inspiration: if ye realise this not ask of those who possess the Message.,Yima la'atun zandoci tun shi wyo dzo lea sai de eza bagizhi nazhi ma Yi ajin yi jin wahayi ya na. Ye mae gbin eza kpikpe nazhie pa Soko na gan wun'a yi gan yede kpikpeana.
Surah 16:44,           (We sent them) with Clear Signs and Books of dark prophecies; and We have sent down unto thee (also) the Message; that thou mayest explain clearly to men what is sent for them and that they may give thought.,(Yi tun'a tun fi ye) be hujjazhi na bayaniazhi tula na to be Litafizhi. Yi ma Alkuranu (yan sinsantu) cin bea ya wyoe ebo wyo jin bayanio ya zazhi yan yannazhi acinbe ya na ujin wo be wuncin'y aga'afe zanazhie kpaye na.
Surah 16:45  ,             Do then those who devise evil (plots) feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up or that the Wrath will not seize them from directions they little perceive-,Ngba zanazhie jin makirinci dedezhi na a sundan gan Soko tan'afi wo be kin yin'a koma azaba'ubeu yaa dagan bana a kpaye tua na'a yan'a
Surah 16:46  ,    Or that He may not call them to account in the midst of their goings to and fro without a chance of their frustrating Him-,Koma u la'au wan kpantsu kui mini dalo dazhin'a zhio ama gan (Soko) gwa woa.
Surah 16:47 ,      Or that He may not call them to account by a process of slow wastage - for thy Lord is indeed full of kindness and mercy.,Koma u la'au wan eti hallaka jin'o karayin. Hakika Tsoci ye Etsu tosayi uyio Etsu yegun uyio.
Surah 16:48   ,             Do they not look at Allah´s creation (even) among (inanimate) things- How their (very) shadows turn round from the right and the left prostrating themselves to Allah and that in the humblest manner,Kashi acin le lo eba yannazhi Soko jin na'a ndondo miniabo fifingi azhie yagwa lo gwa'alo to gwa'apinzhi amae jin sujada ya Soko amae dakpya zhizhi baeni boa.
Surah 16:49 ,            And to Allah doth obeisance all that is in the heavens and on earth whether moving (living) creatures or the angels: for none are arrogant (before their Lord).,Yannazhi fi sanmao kpata na to nazhi fi kinbo mini dabbazhio na kpata Soko gae jin sujada yao amae lati dan fin boa.Surah 16:50      They all revere their Lord high above them and they do all that they are commanded.E sundan Tsoci dagan fitiabo amae jin yan na aga jin'a foro be jin jin-y-na.
Surah 16:51   ,        Allah has said: "Take not (for worship) two gods: for He is just One Allah: then fear Me (and Me alone).",Soko ma gan: Ega la Tsoci guba Soko ma hakika Soko Tsoci Nini uyio. Mi gbaugi gama yea sundan'o.
Surah 16:52,          To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth and to Him is duty due always: then will ye fear other than Allah,Yannazhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo na kpata Soko wun'o jin jin adini ma wyun gbaugi ga wun'baeni bo. Ngba yandoci najin Sokoa na ga ye sundan'o
Surah 16:53  ,         And ye have no good thing but is from Allah: and moreover when ye are touched by distress unto Him ye cry with groans;,Yandondo nama ga dan beye yin yan eman-wo na dagan eba Soko bo afebeo; gancin ma egun ndoci ga tswan ye ebau ga ye yea la egiti lo.
Surah 16:54   ,      Yet when He removes the distress from you behold! some of you turn to other gods to join with their Lord-,Gancin ma ugaa egun la'a keyabo yaye zandocczhi mini yebo ajin afe la yandocizhia pa Tsoci baci.
Surah 16:55 ,    (As if) to show their ingratitude for the favours we have bestowed on them! then enjoy (your brief day): but soon will ye know (your folly)!,Ebo adeba'a cin mana'abo be yannazhi yi la twarya ya'a na. Efe wo ma izhe degi bele-yin yea be de kpikpe.
Surah 16:56  ,         And they (even) assign to things they do not know a portion out of that which We have bestowed for their sustenance! By Allah ye shall certainly be called to account for your false inventions.,Ama'ajin afe la robo ndoci ya yan na akpe egun'u ko anfaniu yea na dagan mini arziki nazhi yi la ya'a na. (ke eba-san boci jin kuti jin na) Wallahi hakika a gbin'egan eti yannazhi ye fe tswa yan ganmana na.
Surah 16:57  ,    And they assign daughters for Allah! - Glory be to Him! - and for themselves (sons- the issue) they desire!,Ama'ajin afe la egi ynzagizhi a ya Soko lili kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko (ke wuncin lugwa) atso cie la (egi bagi) nazhi ade shahawa'ana aya eti tacin'atso zhi.
Surah 16:58 ,       When news is brought to one of them of (the birth of) a female (child) his face darkens and he is filled with inward grief!,Ama ga ya zaeni miniabo labari be mima egi yinzagi fuskau gaashi zhiko yangban'u maga'a yin sarauyin.
Surah 16:59                  With shame does he hide himself from his people because of the bad news he has had! Shall he ,retain it on (sufferance and) contempt or bury it in the dust Ah! what an evil (choice) they decide on,Ucia jin ufe swo ye ya zawangizhi ebo labari dede na'a ya wyun na ngba wyun la egiu gwo eti egbao kashi wyundau la wyun'u swo'u gun kinbo Hakika hukunci wuncin nae ba na wun'a biye.
Surah 16:60,           To those who believe not in the Hereafter applies the similitude of evil: to Allah applies the highest similitude: for He is the Exalted in Power full of Wisdom.,Zanazhie jin imani Efo zoba yin'ana ayibe misali dede. Soko gama wun siffa natso latu gan nao. Wyun ga mayi Etsu zankpeo Etsu hikimao

Soko gama wun siffa natso latu gan nao. Wyun ga mayi Etsu zankpeo Etsu hikimao.
Surah 16:61      ,                If Allah were to punish men for their wrong-doing He would not leave on the (earth) a single living creature: but He gives them respite for a stated Term: When their Term expires they would not be able to delay (the punishment) for a single hour just as they would not be able to anticipate it (for a single hour).,Da acigan Sokoe wan zawangizhi wan be zwalunciazhi (lefiazhi) da wyun'a ya dabba ndondo (zandondo nae dazan ta kinbo na) ke kpe eti kinboa amaade wyun'e pata yaa da lokaci ndoci nayi kpikpeci (ebaubo na).

Surah 16:62,                They attribute to Allah what they hate (for themselves) and their tongues assert the falsehood that all good things are for themselves: without doubt for them is the Fire and they will be the first to be hastened on into it!,Amaajin afe la yan je Soko na atsoe navo na gintara'azhi cia fe zun ganmana kede hakika zoba wangi ga'ajin tabbata ya a na. Egandin ndondo danboa hakika aga wun enao hakikama a cea ce fi bo ke yegun Soko lugwa.
Surah 16:63    ,            By Allah We (also) sent (Our messengers) to Peoples before thee; but Satan made (to the wicked) their own acts seem alluring: He is also their patron today but they shall have a most grievous penalty.,Wallahi Yi tun Tucizhi fi alumma nazhi shi wyodzo na shetan cia etun dedezhi la pa nin fia wyun gayi ndakata'a yin nao azaba na ma tan na ga'ajin tabbata ya'a.
Surah 16:64,             And We sent down the Book to thee for the express purpose that thou shouldst make clear to them those things in which they differ and that it should be a guide and a mercy to those who believe.,Yi ma cin Litafi cin be ya wyo ya'a saide ebo wyo yo jin bayanio yaa eti yannazhi e cedozhi leba dan mini'ubo na u mayi bawu be yegun'y ya zanazhi ga imani jin na.

Surah 16:66,                And verily in cattle (too) will ye find an instructive sign.

Surah 16:71      ,               Allah has bestowed His gifts of sustenance more freely on some of you than on others: those more favoured are not going to throw back their gifts to those whom their right hands possess so as to be equal in that respect.

Surah 16:76     ,                       Allah sets forth (another) Parable of two men: one of them dumb with no power of any sort; a wearisome burden is he to his master; whichever way be directs him he brings no good: is such a man equal with one who commands Justice and is on a Straight Way,Soko ma ke la misali yan eza bagi guba ndocizhi be-be zaeni miniabo edingi uyio ude iko ta eti yandondo boa uciazhe kara wyun'a yakpe ndakatau baenio bandondo nama aga zheu lo na wyun'ala alheri ndondo be woa.
