Surah 43:1, Ha-Mim,HEU MIM.
Surah 43:2 ,By the Book that makes things clear-,Mie zhi kuti be (Alkuranuy) Litafi nan yi be bayanizhiy naa tula nan.
Surah 43:3  ,   We have made it a Qur´an in Arabic that ye may be able to understand (and learn wisdom).,Akika Yi'u la afe Alkuranu be zhimi larubawazhiy ebo ye la'efe eza ankalizhi.
Surah 43:3  ,   We have made it a Qur´an in Arabic that ye may be able to understand (and learn wisdom).,Akika Yi'u la afe Alkuranu be zhimi larubawazhiy ebo ye la'efe eza ankalizhi.
Surah 43:4    ,  And verily it is in the Mother of the Book in Our Presence high (in dignity) full of wisdom.,Akika Alkuranu dan mini Nna yan Litafizhio (lauhul-Mahfuz) eba Yi bo ma Alkuranu litafi na latu nan uyio naa,she be hikimae nan.
Surah 43:5     ,  Shall We then take away the Message from you and repel (you) for that ye are a people transgressing beyond bounds,Kashiy Yi ga cin cin be yan sinsantu lugwaa baenio ebo nan ye yeafe za nanzhie nyin yan kpe kin bo nan
Surah 43:6  ,   But how many were the prophets We sent amongst the peoples of old,Eka nan dokun nan Yi tun Annabi fi jamaa yan mafarizhi.
Surah 43:7 ,      And never came there a prophet to them but they mocked him.,A ma de Annabi ndondo nan be ya'a na'a sai de 'afe la'u mi.
Surah 43:8   ,   So We destroyed (them)- stronger in power than these;- and (thus) has passed on the Parable of the peoples of old.,Yimaa za nazhiy gboka gan'a nan jin hallaka iri az'aba nan tswan za mafarizhi na cia da eti atso gwo gan.
Surah 43:9     ,    If thou wert to question them ´Who created the heavens and the earth´ They would be sure to reply ´they were created by (Him) the Exalted in Power Full of Knowledge´;-,Wallahi wyo ga gbin'a gan gan: Ziy jin alitta sanmazhi to kin yin'o Akika a'yazhe gan Soko Etsu zankpe Etsu kpikpe ga jin alittaao.
Surah 43:10     ,     (Yea the same that) has made for you the earth (like a carpet) spread out and has made for you roads (and channels) therein in order that ye may find guidance (on the way);,Etsu naa kin ta cici ya ye parae nan U cia ekozhi sa fi bo ya ye nan. Ebo ye debae laede bawu nan.
Surah 43:11     ,      That sends down (from time to time) rain from the sky in due measure;- and We raise to life therewith a land that is dead; even so will ye be raised (from the dead);-Etsu nae du ele zhin dagan sanmao be tsunwan'e nan Yicia ezhi tsutsucizhi dan rayi be'u yin. A cin ga ga a ku ye tso tinya dagan kabariezhi bo.
Surah 43:12    ,      That has created pairs in all things and has made for you ships and cattle on which ye ride,Etsu nan jin alitta eba be yiwozhiy kpata nan U ci kezhe jin eya nuwanzhi nan yeade ganfi nan to dabbazhiy nanzhiy yede tu nan.
Surah 43:13  ,                 In order that ye may sit firm and square on their backs and when so seated ye may celebrate the (kind) favour of your Lord and say "Glory to Him Who has subjected these to our (use) for we could never have accomplished this (by ourselves),Ebo ye debae lae fedun'ekpe zunmaabo yemae fe pa niimayan Tsoci yezhi kami nan ye gaa fe dun ta etiabo nan ye mae gan gan:Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya Etsu naa (e yan tuci) nan nan jin foro ya yi nan akika yi de kagbo ndondo ta eti ezan daa bo'a.
Surah 43:14  , "And to our Lord surely must we turn back!"Akika kpata yi ma eba Tsoci yi ga yia kezhe lo.
Surah 43:15     ,   Yet they attribute to some of His servants a share with Him (in his godhead)! truly is man a blasphemous ingrate avowed!,Acia za ndoci tsa ya'u mini wuzhi'u zhio (ke wun ga yi egi wun'o nan) akika zawangi eza uyio nae cin manan bo be Sokoenan manan cin'bo naa tula nan.
Surah 43:16 ,     What! has He taken daughters out of what He himself creates and granted to you sons for choice,Ngba wun'a egi ynzagizhi tsa mini alittauzhio U cia ye tsa be egi bagizhiy
Surah 43:17     ,      When news is brought to one of them of (the birth of) what he sets up as a likeness to (Allah) Most Gracious his face darkens and he is filled with inward grief!,A ma ga ya zaeni miniabo labari yangban fa be egi ynzagiy nan'e da gan gan: Soko Al-Rahmanu tsa gan. Na fuska u ga'shi zhiko yangban'u ci ga'nyin.
Surah 43:18    ,    Is then one brought up among trinkets and unable to give a clear account in a dispute (to be associated with Allah),Ngba' (ye ga dangi tsa ya Soko). Be za nae sa sa dan mini ninpao nan za nan man ka wun'abe ewun sunzhi wun'a kpe gan ri woa nan
Surah 43:19      ,     And they make into females angels who themselves serve Allah. Did they witness their creation Their evidence will be recorded and they will be called to account!,Acia Malaikazhi nazhiy yi wuzhi Soko na la ynzagizhi. Beke a jin ri jinka mi nan a jin alittaa nan A kika a ga eri azhi ka a-maa gbin'a gan (efo Alkiyamiy).
Surah 43:20   ,           ("Ah!") they say "If it had been the will of (Allah) Most Gracious we should not have worshipped such (deities)!" Of that they have no knowledge! they do nothing but lie!,Aci gan: Wun'a ba Soko Al-Rahmanu ba ngan yi yaajin bauta ya (Malaikazhia). Ade kpikpe ndoci eti wuncin boa akika a de'tswa ganmana tswa kawanyin.
Surah 43:21  ,     What! have We given them a Book before this to which they are holding fast,Kashiy Yi la Litafi ndoci laa ya'a shi Alkuranu dzo Wuncin ci la a egwa sun'u gbanyin.
Surah 43:22  ,        Nay! they say: "We found our fathers following a certain religion and we do guide ourselves by their footsteps.",Ade gan: Akika yi tsun yanmanci yizhi kpe eti izhe le iri ndocio etaazhi ga ma yi ga emi tuo.
Surah 43:23     ,               Just in the same way whenever We sent a Warner before thee to any people the wealthy ones among them said: "We found our fathers following a certain religion and we will certainly follow in their footsteps.",Acinga ga u ma yio Yi laa tun gangba jin ci tun dan ezhi ndocio shi wyo dzo lea sai de bagwo deciazhi a'gan gan: Yi de tsun yanmanci yizhi tsun ta eti eko izhe le ndocio Yi ma etaazhi ga ga emi tuo.
Surah 43:24     ,        He said: "What! Even if I brought you better guidance than that which ye found your fathers following" They said: "For us we deny that ye (prophets) are sent (on a mission at all).",Gan gan: Asa bawu nan mi la be nan U gye gan natso ye tsun yanmanci yezhi kpe tiubo naa A gan: Yi de ajin kafirinci be yan nan a tun yetun nae.
Surah 43:25  ,    So We exacted retribution from them: now see what was the end of those who rejected (Truth)!,Yicia wo gbata. Cin kendoe zoba yan ganmanan zuncizhiy nan le.
Surah 43:26     ,   Behold! Abraham said to his father and his people: "I do indeed clear myself of what ye worship,:Kami na (Annabi Ibrahima gan be Babau yin to Jamaa yan'u zhi nan.jin bauta yanan.
Surah 43:27,    "(I worship) only Him Who made me and He will certainly guide me.",Sai de za nan jin alitta mi nan akika Wun ga wu mi bao.
Surah 43:28   ,   And he left it as a Word to endure among those who came after him that they may turn back (to Allah).,Uci'u fe egan wanciko naa dan'ubo fe lo mini zuriya'u zhio na ebo zawangizhi a daazhin eko (yan gaskiya).
Surah 43:29    ,    Yea I have given the good things of this life to these (men) and their fathers until the Truth has come to them and a messenger making things clear.,A'a Mi dea za nananzhiy to yanmanciazhi ya fi izheo fe wo ma har be lokaci nan gaskiya (Alkuranu) be yaa nan ganni be Tuciy naa tula nan.
Surah 43:30   ,     But when the Truth came to them they said: "This is sorcery and we do reject it.",Kamina gaskiya (Alkuranu) be yaa nan a gan: nan nan eyan ma uyio yima'a kafirinci jin beu yin.
Surah 43:31     ,    Also they say: "Why is not this Qur´an sent down to some leading man in either of the two (chief) cities",A ci gan: Kiy la aci cin Alkuranu nan nan be ya bagi ko ndoci mini Alkarya guba nazhiy wancin nan boa yin'o
Surah 43:32    ,                    Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of thy Lord It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in the life of this world: and We raise some of them above others in ranks so that some may command work from others. But the Mercy of thy Lord is better than the (wealth) which they amass.,Kashi a gae gan eryatwa yan Tsoci wyo yo Ngan Yi gae gan Arzikiazhi ya' izhe bo Yi maa daraja yan sashiazhi la'ata eti yan sashio ebo adeba la dozhi etun yegun yan Tsoci wyo ma ude alheri gan (eyan izhe) nanzhiy e ku ye kan nan.
Surah 43:33    ,            And were it not that (all) men might become of one (evil) way of life We would provide for everyone that blasphemes against (Allah) Most Gracious silver roofs for their houses and (silver) stair-ways on which to go up,Ka'Ujin ebo nan zawangizhi a bea zhe'a yan ni na boa (eba fitina eyande izheo naa) da yi ga katanti yan emi kafirizhi laafe azurfa to ekpa nanzhiy a fe da lo (kata) fiti nan.
Surah 43:34  ,  And (silver) doors to their houses and thrones (of silver) on which they could recline,Yi maa kezhea kpako yan emiazhi to gado'azhi (jin be azurfae) nan a fe de kpetso ta nan.
Surah 43:35  ,         And also adornments of gold. But all this were nothing but conveniences of the present life: The Hereafter in the sight of thy Lord is for the Righteous.,To kaya ninpazhi kpata wuncinzhi ma eyan emawo izhe ayio akika ma emi yan zoba wangi wun'ajin tabbata ya za nanzhie tswa Soko nan.
Surah 43:36    ,      If anyone withdraws himself from remembrance of (Allah) Most Gracious We appoint for him an evil one to be an intimate companion to him.,Zandondo nan gae le izhe ke pipa Soko lugwa nan Yi ga shaitan laa pa ma beu yin Uci gaazhe eya manciu.
Surah 43:37 ,     Such (evil ones) really hinder them from the Path but they think that they are being guided aright!Akika ma shaitanzhi ga'a kan eko guruzhi yinda acia fe le ye ke eko bawu bo a kpeo nan.
Surah 43:38   ,       At length when (such a one) comes to Us he says (to his evil companion): "Would that between me and thee were the distance of East and West!" Ah! evil is the companion (indeed)!,Har da lokaci nan zaguba'aba a be be eba Yi nan za wuncin cia gan gan: Kasa re da' aci gan kpikpe-ya dan tsakanimi bo be wyo yin ke tsakani eyi lazhin be eyilozun'y nan (wun'a ba mi gan) akika eya dede wyo yio.

Surah 43:39   ,     When ye have done wrong it will avail you nothing that Day that ye shall be partners in Punishment!,(Uzuri nan nan) wun'a jin ye anfani yinnaa ebo nan ye yea eti tacin yezhi jin zwalunci (dagan izhe boa ni). Akika azaba gabo yea fi gannio.
Surah 43:40    ,      Canst thou then make the deaf to hear or give direction to the blind or to such as (wander) in manifest error,Ngba wyo la tukpa tenci wo gan wo Kashi wyo la ye bonci leba ye wo To za nan gaafe dan mini egbin nan a tula nan (ngba wyo la'u ke eko wo)

Surah 43:45    ,        And question thou our messengers whom We sent before thee; did We appoint any deities other than (Allah) Most Gracious to be worshipped,Wyo mao gbin Tuci nanzhi Yi tun-tun shi wyodzo nan gan ngba Yila Tsoci ndoci cici nan alittazhi a jin bauta ya baci Soko ALRAHMANUO nan
